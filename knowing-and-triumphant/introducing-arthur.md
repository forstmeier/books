"Hello, there" came a chipper, mechanical voice.  

A tall, thin, humanoid robot stepped into the room carrying a set of clothes in Damien's size.  

"H-Hello" answered Damien.    

"My name is Arthur, designation T19-73, assigned as attendant to your person" the robot continued cheerfully "I'll be available to assist you in any way that you need. Here's a change of clothes."  

Damien proceeded to dress himself as the robot went about collecting the discarded medical gown and slippers. It was an odd sensation, putting on real clothes for the first time. They were somewhat utilitarian in design and had small mechanical nodes and plates affixed to them as if they were the base layer to some larger pieces of equipment the wearer could apply.  

"Your arrival has been highly anticipated," chatted the robot amiably. "A great deal of excitement has grown around you in recent weeks. I suppose your activation is something similar to that of an organic human birth: long expected but still a surprise when it finally happens."
