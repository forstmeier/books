The hologram of Simon floated forward slightly. Simon spoke in his harsh, mechanical voice, "I can confirm these statements made by Chairman Lewis. Additionally, he has provided me with his private journals and logs of actions taken by the conspirators."

Holographic documents and notes rapidly appeared in succession above the table. It was all as Lewis had said.

Card turned on More in a fury.

"This is an absolute outrage!" he bellowed. "We will get to the bottom of this; you will be coming with us as well until we can sort this atrocity out."

More's face was absolutely calm despite the realization she had now been played into a corner.

Card then turned to face Lewis.

"None of this absolves you from the investigation and you will be detained until further notice for your part in the manipulation of this project! Issue a warrant for the arrest of Dr. Belloc; Ms. More, I order you to stand down and surrender immediately."

A smile appeared on More's face; it was sardonic and conveyed no happiness. The look on her face was so different from what Peter had seen before. This was the cold and calculating side of the woman. No longer did she appear as the loving mother and life-giver - she was now a ruthless killer.

"No," she said firmly. "We will be continuing our mission whether or not you support it. The good of all is at stake and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that we succeed."

The full declaration had been made and the glove had been thrown down. More nodded to her combat retinue. They raised their weapons and some stepped forward towards Lewis while the rest formed up facing Card's forces.

"Seize them!" shouted Card.
