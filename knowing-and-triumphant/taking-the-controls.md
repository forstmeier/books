Peter walked to the center of the circular patterns on the floor - all was quiet but for muffled sounds of the Mover as it continued to trod across the surface of the world. There was a brief pause as Peter looked out at the expansive landscape before him.

Suddenly the floor beneath him began to hum in a barely perceptible tone as if responding to his presence. Under his feet, the marking on the floor began to ignite in an orange-yellow glow. Running through the circles and lines it looked like molten gold coursing through smelting troughs.

In his head, Peter could feel something reaching out to him, asking for his approval; it was as if he were standing at a door that was waiting for his key.

He let himself go.

He "heard" or "felt" a click go off in his head and pieces of the floor below his feet began to break apart along the patterned lines. Arcs and circular pieces of the floor rose from the ground. Some were suspended by robotic arms extending from below the floor while others were held in place by unseen mechanics.

Peter raised his arms laterally and splayed his fingers.

Blue-green holograms swirled into existence around him. They formed circular patterns around his body, limbs, and digits.

He settled into place suspended in the center of the room. Now he was the Mover.

"Congratulations," she Millie's voice in his ear, "you've taken another step towards your ascension."
