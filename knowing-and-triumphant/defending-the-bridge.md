Before he could regain his balance there was a blast from the hallway behind him. The boarding party had arrived.

Dozens of robots sprinted into the corridor towards the control room. Peter shot a glance behind him and the scene he caught unfolded as if it were in slow motion.

A split second after they breached, Arthur launched into a sprint towards the invaders. Some leapt into the air towards him - others bounded and bounced from the walls - all propelled by their greater-than-human mechanical strength - to attack their lone opponent from all angles. Arthur ran to meet them and hurled himself into the fray.

Every move was like an acrobat performing; with every pivot and launch he slammed into the combatants. Striking and dismantling, he used every twist to gain momentum and propel himself towards his next quarry. Despite the overwhelming numerical disadvantage, Millie's raw processing power was proving to be a deadly edge.

His whirling dance landed him in the center of the group and for a brief moment, there was a bubble of space separating him from his opponents. A pistol seemed to appear in his hand and in movements almost too fast for Peter to comprehend, he undulated in sharp twists, flicking off several shots, each finding a mark.

And then, just as his enemies leaped forward brandishing their own firearms, a small ball of blue fire appeared in Arthur's hand hovering in his open palm. From the pilot light sprang a stream of liquid fire, like a flamethrower which he cast in circles all about him engulfing his opponents and obscuring him from Peter's view.
