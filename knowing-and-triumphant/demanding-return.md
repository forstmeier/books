Once the city skyline fell out of sight Lewis turned to Peter, "Did you receive your name?"

Peter didn't answer.

"You did."

Peter remained silent.

"Then you received what was required from that meeting," and with that, Lewis moved off to the other side of the ship, pulled a tablet from a backpack stowed in a corner, and began working.

Several minutes of silence followed; Peter could only stare at the man responsible for his abduction. Everything had happened so fast and so abruptly and now Lewis was sitting there as if nothing had. The jumbled sickness he felt in his stomach was joined by a fiery heat of rage. The silence continued for a few moments as Peter worked up the composure to speak.

"I want to go back."

Millie materialized over his shoulder.

"Chairman if I might-"

"No, you may not," he responded without looking up from his work.

Millie opened her mouth as if to reply but before she could speak, Lewis raised his hand and her mouth closed again silently. He had remotely muted her program. Turning to Peter she raised her eyebrows, her attempt to interject on his behalf stifled.

"That is not where you are needed," continued Lewis.

"Bring me back," demanded Peter. Despite his best efforts, his voice wobbled somewhat as he spoke.

"No."

Peter spun to face the ship's helm.

"Arthur, where are we going?!"

"I'm very sorry, sir," the robot responded, "I'm under orders to refrain from informing you as to our destination yet."

Had Arthur been his secret guard the entire time? Clearly, he wasn't his friend.
