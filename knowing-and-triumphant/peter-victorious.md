Peter stood on the open palm as the Mover steadied itself. He suddenly felt weak in his legs as the full weight of what just happened rushed into his adrenaline-filled brain.

Falling forward, he caught himself on his hands and knees. Numbness swamped his body and he ached everywhere.

"Peter."

It was Millie's voice but it sounded like it was from underwater, far away but recognizable.

Things began to clear and he remembered where he was. He pushed himself up to sit on his heels.

"You will now become the Proctor."

Now he was unexpectedly at ease despite the prospect of his position remaining incredibly daunting. Millie materialized next to him at half size.

"You will have untold responsibility and far greater hardships than even this are undoubtedly ahead but you are now ready and have found your place in this world."

Peter stood.

"You are now truly knowing of your mantle and are donning it triumphant."
