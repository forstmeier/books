Arthur dipped the ship lower into the edges of the dust cloud.

"We have no desire to leave or to dominate the natural world," continued Lewis. "Any attempt to totally recreate and replace the physical world we inhabit, even with more perfect alternatives, would be an abomination. At most, we seek to work with and direct it, more like parents guiding their children. Even in these artificial constructs, we still encourage natural and organic progression. It is part of the great and terrible mantle that we bear as humans."

"Look down there," Lewis said, pointing down towards a group of figures in the dust.

They were short, humanoid figures, with long, thin necks. Plain white masks with small featureless eye holes gave their faces a calm and almost monastic appearance. Several were grouped around a medium-sized lizard-like creature lying unconscious on a little medical table low to the ground.

One reached out a long hand which separated into fine cilium and appeared to insert into the nape of the neck of the lizard. It twitched and slowly opened its eyes as the humanoid withdrew its touch. Suddenly, it became aware of its position and with an awkward bark leaped from the table and scampered out and away from the construction zone into the desert. The group of humanoids appeared to communicate among themselves and then packed up their equipment.

"Those are the Artisans" spoke Lewis breaking into Peter's rapt attention to the scene below.

"What were they doing?"

"They were activating one of the native animals to _Pangea_ which they themselves created."

"But they're not human."

"No, they are not. They are another ITAM fabrication. Peaceful beings with semi-sentience with the sole purpose of building and creating. We generally leave them to their own devices and they naturally seek to improve their surroundings. I wish I could be one of them," he said wistfully but with genuine desire.
