She glanced down the table at the impassive Lewis.

"We're here to take you to your final stage of installment, Peter - your network connection aboard the battleship _Thulcandra_."

"I thought it was going to be on board a Mover like the one that we saw on our...journey," said Peter in surprise.

More shook her head definitively.

"No, the proper location is on board the _Thulcandra_ as it affords more mobility and the ability to assert control wherever it is needed. This will help you help humanity by traveling to where you are most needed."

This was her plan. She and Belloc were hoping to have absolute control over the Proctor interface and by extension, Peter, the Proctor, himself. By placing a network connection in a location under their control he could be kept out of the hands of others and away from the independent junction on board the Proctor Mover - the latter was Lewis's goal.

"That's not where I was supposed to go originally."

More blinked.

"Changes needed to be made to the plan. This is truly for the betterment of humanity; we're not altering the core mission, just the method in which it is executed."

"Small deviations early create trajectories that fall far wide of the target," spoke up Lewis from his end of the table.

A look of absolute fire and silent hatred shot from More's eyes towards Lewis who continued gazing at the table. Factions had clearly formed and given the weapons and armor, violence could very well be the next step. Peter hoped it wouldn't come to that again.

More looked back to Peter.

"Peter, you MUST come with me - our world, our people, need this from you."

Silently, Peter looked down at the table.

"You MUST come, Peter. We cannot let you go otherwise."

Her tone was increasingly pleading, bordering on demanding. She was effectively calling for Peter's submission. He still wanted desperately to trust her; he couldn't bear to lose that friend, that mother figure in his new life.

A sinking feeling, one that engulfed everything, came to swallow him whole. He didn't want to swim away - he wanted it to consume him and make all of this disappear.
