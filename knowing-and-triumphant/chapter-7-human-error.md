Peter's helmet retracted from his face and down into his upper armor plates. Inside the Mover was cool and a steady rumble of machinery could be heard behind the hallway walls. These corridors were clearly more functional; exposed metal plates and pipes could be seen as the pair moved quickly deeper into the belly of the beast. After passing through several of these tunnels they came to a more "finished" section with sleek black floors and white walls.

They ran down the hall with Peter leading the way. He knew where to go - he could see the pathway in his head.

In short order, they reached an elevator which rose to the higher levels of the Mover and opened on a small, spherical antechamber connected to a somewhat wider hallway with a tall ceiling. Jogging down the hall, they came to a closed door at the far end. Peter opened it with a wave of his hand.

Before them was a large cavernous room.

Its dark floors were polished to a reflective sheen; inlaid etchings formed large circular patterns emanating from the center of the room. The dark gray walls were also polished and rose up in a tall dome. On the far side was a massive screen showing that the open expanse of the _Pangea_ grassland. Steady movement over the scenery indicated that this was the visual coming from the Mover's eyes.

Peter walked to the center of the circular patterns on the floor - all was quiet but for muffled sounds of the Mover as it continued to trod across the surface of the world. There was a brief pause as Peter looked out at the expansive landscape before him.

Suddenly the floor beneath him began to hum in a barely perceptible tone as if responding to his presence. Under his feet, the marking on the floor began to ignite in an orange-yellow glow. Running through the circles and lines it looked like molten gold coursing through smelting troughs.

In his head, Peter could feel something reaching out to him, asking for his approval; it was as if he were standing at a door that was waiting for his key.

He let himself go.

He "heard" or "felt" a click go off in his head and pieces of the floor below his feet began to break apart along the patterned lines. Arcs and circular pieces of the floor rose from the ground. Some were suspended by robotic arms extending from below the floor while others were held in place by unseen mechanics.

Peter raised his arms laterally and splayed his fingers.

Blue-green holograms swirled into existence around him. They formed circular patterns around his body, limbs, and digits.

He settled into place suspended in the center of the room. Now he was the Mover.

"Congratulations," she Millie's voice in his ear, "you've taken another step towards your ascension."

He was now aware of the Mover's situation. Bringing it to a halt, he began gradually turning the behemoth to face its pursuer. It was still a long way off but the distance would close quickly given their relative scale.

Out of the corner of his eye, Peter noticed something - among the array of holograms surrounding him, he could see several indicating approaching vessels. He turned his head to regard them - the Mover's head turned in tandem. A handful of airships was closing in on them and he could see squads of flying robots disembarking. They were the vanguard. The robots zipped towards Peter's Mover; he had no means of stopping them and their boarding was both imminent and inevitable.

Peter turned and looked at Arthur who was observing the scene.

"They are coming," said Peter.

Arthur nodded.

"Millie." She materialized next to Peter. "Go with Arthur."

"Right," she responded before bounding down Peter's arm, jumping into the air between him and Arthur and disappearing. Arthur twitched his head.

"We're ready," spoke both Arthur and Millie's voices from the robot's mouth.

A hologram appeared before Peter showing the vanguard had blasted through the sealed hatch and were entering into the Mover's body.

"I will do what I can to hold them off, sir," said Arthur and turned back towards the hallway that they had entered a few minutes prior, the only point of entry.

Peter turned back to the viewscreen before him and began marching towards the oncoming giant. He reached out through the network trying to ascertain who his opponent was, who he was up against. He shivered. The presence on the other side was unmistakable.

It was Belloc.

He must have left to seize his Mover while More had been confronting them at Scholl to establish a fallback in the event they needed a last-ditch defense. If they weren't able to control the Proctor they would intercept and destroy the connection to the network. Peter sensed that Belloc and More still hoped only to apprehend him but were resolved to use lethal force if necessary.

The massive entities lumbering towards each other were rapidly closing the distance. At the same time, Peter could feel that the robot intruders were near at hand.

But before him, the battle had begun.

Belloc's Mover was now within striking distance. It swung a massive blow towards Peter. He braced himself on his command platform and raised his arm in defense - the platform and the holograms swirled around him, adjusting to his input.

His Mover raised its arm to counter but the blow still glanced off its head. The room lurched to the side from the impact. Peter stepped with the hit into a shallow crouch and in one smooth motion straightened up and threw a punch straight forward. Belloc sidestepped but still received a glancing blow of his own from the retaliatory strike.

Without stopping, Peter threw his other fist forward but the punch was caught in Belloc's outstretched palm. The other arm swung into view.

Peter raised his free hand to guard but his lumbering counterpart only partially managed to block the oncoming strike. Again, the room jolted heavily. Stumbling backward, Peter raised his hands defensively, struggling to maintain balance.

Belloc pressed the attack. His Mover jumped, or as close to jumping as these giants could come, towards Peter throwing one-two punches. Peter's outstretched arms blocked the blows and he delivered a quick counter jab to the stomach which slightly unbalanced Belloc. But the jab had brought Peter in close and he failed to notice Belloc's hand raised high into the air.

It came smashing down on his head. The entire command room dropped on the impact and Peter would have been thrown from his command platform had it not adjusted to keep him locked in.

Before he could regain his balance there was a blast from the hallway behind him. The boarding party had arrived.

Dozens of robots sprinted into the corridor towards the control room. Peter shot a glance behind him and the scene he caught unfolded as if it were in slow motion.

A split second after they breached, Arthur launched into a sprint towards the invaders. Some leapt into the air towards him - others bounded and bounced from the walls - all propelled by their greater-than-human mechanical strength - to attack their lone opponent from all angles. Arthur ran to meet them and hurled himself into the fray.

Every move was like an acrobat performing; with every pivot and launch he slammed into the combatants. Striking and dismantling, he used every twist to gain momentum and propel himself towards his next quarry. Despite the overwhelming numerical disadvantage, Millie's raw processing power was proving to be a deadly edge.

His whirling dance landed him in the center of the group and for a brief moment, there was a bubble of space separating him from his opponents. A pistol seemed to appear in his hand and in movements almost too fast for Peter to comprehend, he undulated in sharp twists, flicking off several shots, each finding a mark.

And then, just as his enemies leaped forward brandishing their own firearms, a small ball of blue fire appeared in Arthur's hand hovering in his open palm. From the pilot light sprang a stream of liquid fire, like a flamethrower which he cast in circles all about him engulfing his opponents and obscuring him from Peter's view.

Peter ripped his eyes away from the skirmish going on behind him and turned back to the viewer just in time to divert another blow from Belloc.

Another blow, another block, another blow, another glancing hit. The struggle continued between the two titans but Belloc was gaining the upper hand on Peter. His attacks were more ferocious and he was willing to open himself up to counter blows to deliver devastating strikes. Belloc knew Peter was fighting on two fronts and could not maintain control in the cabin for long.

He felt another presence aboard the Mover and a hologram popped up showing another wave of robots converging on the control room. There were too many for Arthur to hold off on his own.

But at this point, their course was set.

With that, he set the onboard artificial intelligence to control the titan and directed it to move away from Belloc. It would be able to conduct some basic defense but it would be no long-term match for Belloc.

Peter disconnected from the platform and jumping down he ran to support Arthur. The invaders began flanking the adjunct who was still engaged in dogged combat, and began breaking towards Peter. As he sprinted towards the oncoming robots, his feet lit the floor patterns with every step, like ripples from a stone falling into a pool.

Just as the two sides closed the gap, Peter dropped to a knee and slammed a punch into the floor. A blue forcefield surged from the ground and rushed outward in a wave of energy that briefly stunned the attackers nearest to Peter. Without pausing, Peter raised his other hand and fired a quick torrent of miniature rockets from his wrist, blowing them to shattered husks.

Another, that had been out of the blast radius, turned towards Peter. Its stature was oddly upright and not in a combat posture like the others had been in. It twitched and then ran towards him.

Arthur, who had incapacitated the remainder of the wave, quickly took in the situation and, decapitating his last opponent who he had been holding in a headlock, launching towards them. The oncoming attacker noticed Arthur from the corner of its vision and pivoted to face him.

But Arthur was too fast.

In the blink of an eye, Arthur delivered a quick series of blows and then went in for the grapple. A kick shattered the robot's knee and with a twist, Arthur wrapped up both the opponent's hands and with his other hand clamped around its throat he forced it into a kneeling position before him.

Just then, a voice came from the robot, a voice Peter instantly recognized.

"Peter."

It was More. Peter froze.

"It's me, Alex."

Peter couldn't move. More must be remotely possessing the robot but it felt like she was there with him in the Mover.

"Come back to us, to me. We're here for you."

Peter couldn't speak.

"This can all be over if you choose it to be so."

Her voice was full of longing. Peter unknowingly took a step towards the avatar.

"We love you, Peter."

He halted, stunned. He'd never heard those words before. Someone, in this world, attesting to a genuine care for his well being, for him. More genuinely felt that way. She cared about him.

Before anything else could happen, Arthur looked back towards the viewscreen - Peter followed his gaze. The opposing Mover was quickly closing the distance Peter had temporarily put between them.

Just then, two more robot soldiers entered the room in a sprint from the hallway. Nothing was stopping them from freely entering the Mover.

Arthur shoved the restrained robot down and away, jumping and twisting to avoid the laser fire from the intruders across the room. Before the avatar could catch its balance, Arthur squeezed off a single mid-air shot which passed cleanly through its temple. The robot slumped to the ground. Arthur fired off several shots into the two attackers quickly damaging them before finishing them off with similarly precise headshots.

Millie appeared over Arthur's shoulder.

"I'm sorry," she said quickly, "but that was necessary. She was just stalling for time even if she does care."

She pointed towards the viewscreen. "Additional soldiers are on their way to seize us and this Mover. They'll be in overwhelming numbers soon. I've copied some advanced combat tactics into Arthur's memory so he will be capable of acting on his own at a relatively higher level without my computational assistance - it'll be to a lesser extent than when I'm with him, but it will have to do."

"I will hold them off, sir" spoke up Arthur, "This Mover will need to remain in action as long as possible."

"Thank you, Arthur", said Peter with a nod.

"I'll be coming with you," said Millie.

Peter nodded again and extended his hand. Millie walked forward through the air, disappearing briefly as she passed between the two, and reappeared over Peter's shoulder. He turned and sprinted down the hallway passing through the carnage of the recent battle ascending towards the uppermost levels of the Mover. Several great jolts shook them about as they rose higher and higher; apparently, Belloc has closed the gap and reengaged the two giants in their "macro" fight.

Finally, they reached a small access hatch to the outside shell. Opening it and jumping through, they found themselves on the large armor plate of the Mover's hunched upper shoulder.

Peter steadied himself as he took in the scene before him.

The two great beings were locked in combat. He felt a shiver run down his neck; he could imagine the great choruses of humanity resting in the balance of this combat, watching and raising their voices in great song. Another massive strike swung in from Belloc's Mover and the "ground" beneath them lurched sideways. It slid freely under Peter's feet for a moment and he had to catch himself again.

Regaining his footing, he ran forward along the great, sloping plate. As the downturn curvature increased he dropped into a controlled slide downward along the plates' surface. He dropped onto a small extended piece of the shell and propped himself against the steep slope of the armor, now a wall behind him.

"Focus" spoke Millie in his ear, "I'll help you direct a blast."

Peter stared across at the opposing titan. He raised his hand, palm out and fingers extended. Holograms began appearing and enveloping his outstretched hand and wrist. A shiver went down his spine for a split second. Electricity began coursing down his arm and through his hand and then it released.

Great bolts shot from his fingertips, not unlike Lewis's from earlier, but without the aid of the gauntlets and much more powerful. Thick tendrils of blue-white light cascaded across the distance and slammed into the upper shoulder of the opposing giant. An explosion erupted at the point of impact and smoke rose from the blast wound like weightless blood.

"AGAIN!" shouted Millie excitedly.

Peter focused again and another torrent of lightning streamed out from his hand, this time to strike the central armor chest plate. Millie was shouting wildly in his helmet from excitement.

Its head rotated and giant eyes came to focus on him, the source of its annoyance. A massive hand swung towards Peter's location; he braced for launch against the plate behind him.

"NOW!" shouted Millie.

Peter leaped forward propelled by a telekinetic blast. His helmet snapped into place as his boosters fired quickly accelerating him out of the way of the incoming blow which connected with the Proctor Mover, missing Peter.

But Belloc was no longer concerned with that giant - his focus was totally on Peter and he began pivoting his Mover in an attempt to keep the small flying figure in view. Zipping higher out of reach, Peter cut the power to his boosters and felt Millie helping him focus yet another blast.

"Ready" she clipped in his ear.

Another blast - this one connected with the side of the Mover's head but it still managed to swing at Peter who popped out of the way of the lumbering arm.

Swooping up and around, he wrung his brain for his next move.

The current situation was only a brief stalemate. He couldn't defeat his enemy using the Proctor Mover, it would soon be overrun. He couldn't destroy it from his flying vantage point, he didn't have the power and even if he did, the circling gunboats would certainly move in, likely with more reinforcements and overwhelm him. Something had to change.

Below him, he noticed that Belloc's Mover was moving less "organically"; it was still watching him but its arms had become less active and were not bracing to swing at him. It was as if it had settled into a "passive" mode. The autopilot must have been activated. A few moments later, a hatch opened on its upper shoulder and a figure emerged.

Belloc.

He was clad head to toe in a full armor battle suit. He looked up and stared calmly at the flying Peter.

"He wants to fight," said Millie.

"Clearly."

"He's confident he has the playing field skewed in his favor. Otherwise he wouldn't face you if he didn't think he had a way to win. But...this is probably your only chance of achieving victory in this thing."

Peter thought for a moment and then dove towards the plate Belloc was standing on. He lighted a little ways away from Belloc, his helmet retracted exposing his face to the wind.

"We could avoid this, Peter," said Belloc.

It was the first time he had ever used his name.

"Step down and come with me. Back to us, to More."

"There is nothing for me there."

"There is peace, security, all of that is yours, all of that you can provide. You are the Proctor."

"What is it you think you've done?!" shouted Peter. "There is no peace - you started a war for me!"

"It was the only way; it had to be done."

"Then your way is wrong," said Peter, firmly.

"You are refusing to surrender," said Belloc - a statement, not a question.

"I must do my duty."

Belloc pursed his lips, "As must I."

His helmet snapped into place and he leaped at Peter.

A great sword materialized in his hand. Silver metal and glowing orange hard light, faint "embers" could be seen whisping away from it as it cut through the air.

"SWORD!" shouted Millie in Peter's ear.

As if by sheer will, one materialized in Peter's suddenly outstretched hand. It was like he had "called" it from somewhere, composing it from a digital design into physical form with infinitesimal pieces of surrounding matter pulled in as raw material for its assembly. Millie was helping him focus and unearth his abilities; Peter could feel her guidance as he raised his blade to parry Belloc's heavy downward slash. Breaking the lock, their blades began flying as they moved along the rounded surface of the Mover's armor.

Belloc's Mover had again closed the gap with Peter's and the two robots, set in their autopilot mode, began clumsily wrestling again. Peter's Mover landed a massive blow that jolted the ground beneath the duelists' feet throwing them off balance briefly.

Peter regained his footing first and quickly jumped forward, propelling himself with a blast from his boosters. He swung his blade down but Belloc managed to block the blow, their blades locked together again. Peter's armor helped provide him with the strength to push back against Belloc.

Belloc's helmet whipped open revealing his face twisted from exertion.

"You don't want to do this" he grunted through his teeth, "You don't want to have to fight, to have to kill me."

"No, but I will" and breaking their clash, he spun away as Belloc stepped forward, slashing his blade through the air Peter had been a second before.

"That's easier said than done, Peter."

His sword blade ignited into twisting flames and cinders cascaded from it in the wind. With one hand, he battered at Peter's defenses.

"Ending my life would be the easy part but you have to live with what's left of yourself afterward."

He pivoted inwards, suddenly close to Peter and punched him in the face with his gauntleted hand. Peter stumbled backward trying to deflect the onslaught; he was losing ground.

About them, the Mover's were locked in a grapple and Peter quickly jumped away along the titan's outstretched arm. Belloc followed close behind.

Pivoting, Peter turned and cast a swift lighting blast back at Belloc. Belloc's gauntleted hand shot forward, catching the incoming torrent and bracing himself, he pushed back creating a looping energy stream between them.

The connection broke away as the duelists dove out of the way as Peter's bot chopped down on the Belloc Mover's arm. Peter tried to dive past his opponent back onto the shoulder plate but Belloc's blade connected.

He stumbled away caught off balance falling to his knees. His systems indicated that his booster system was nearly completely disabled. There were no more than a handful of small horizontal bursts left if that.

"We're stuck here," said Millie grimly.

Peter pushed himself back to his feet using his sword as a crutch. His sword hung loosely in his hand at his side. He was exhausted.

Belloc knew it and he wasn't about to waste time with some diatribe. He drew his sword back preparing to lunge and then, igniting his boosters, shot forward. Peter brought his blade to the defense and the duelists were at it again.

Attack and parry, blow after blow. It was nothing beautiful as neither was an experienced swordsman. Sheer purpose drove their energy.

Belloc pushed Peter back again. A sudden feint got past the exhausted Peter's defenses. The butt of Belloc's sword smashed into the side of his head, sending Peter stumbling. He barely raised his blade in time to block another downward slash.

Everything was moving in slow motion.

His head hung loosely from his shoulders.

Why keep fighting? What was the point? Fighting was exactly what he wanted to prevent but to prevent it he caused it. The only way to stop it was to give in.

Darkness enveloped him, coldness touched his soul. There was nothing and it consumed him.

"Peter, I'm here with you."

Millie's voice cut through the dark shroud on his mind; he heard her voice but she hadn't spoken.

He could feel her strength and fire, trueness and soundness. Her utter stoicism and strength of being, a being of passion. And now he could feel that same purpose within his own heart but defining him uniquely.

Peter could now see himself.

He was a seeker of truth, a being of duty, a servant to man. He was Peter and he was the Proctor. All this flew through his mind in a brief moment. Looking up through the crossed blades a renewed sense of purpose flooded through his veins.

Planting his foot, he pressed back up against Belloc releasing their deadlock. He extended his hand pushing Belloc away with a telekinetic blast. But the doctor caught himself and shot a blast of lightning at Peter who deflected it away with his sword. Again he fired and again Peter blocked it.

A miniature tornado of fire appeared around Belloc's free arm from the combination of his flame thrower and telekinetic weaponry, quickly growing in intensity and speed. Belloc thrust his arm forward and a column of fire flew at Peter. Calmly, he raised his hand and a pale translucent blue field appeared, shielding him from the onslaught.

When Belloc pulled away, Peter was still standing; he paused, unsure how to next attack his now defensible opponent. With a slight kick, Peter pushed himself into the air and held himself there levitating several yards from the shell of the Mover.

Throughout his body, Peter could feel power coursing with Millie acting in concert with his movements. He closed his eyes and extended his hand up and behind him reaching towards the sun in the sky. Nothing else existed for him in that moment, just his complete focus and will.

A star of fire appeared beyond his outstretched hand and from it shot a swirling column of fire engulfing his arm. It was a greater and purer fire than that produced by Arthur or Belloc. In his chest, he could feel it building and he began mentally to harness it. He could feel every tool at his disposal being pushed to its extreme - fire beyond flame.

A wide loop of fire swirled to surround him like a whirling solar flare.

Peter opened his eyes.

In Belloc's eyes he could see amazement; no fear, just wonder. Peter raised his other hand in Belloc's direction. With a flash, he released the fire.

A great torrent of fire and light poured out and down into the Belloc Mover blasting clean through its armor hide. It stumbled and stopped for a brief moment and then its arms went limp at its sides as it began to collapse in on itself. Superheated metals sprayed molten fragments and internal machinery began to explode. The arching fire subsided as Peter released his hold on the forces and lowered himself back onto the giant's shoulder.

Belloc had been knocked far backward against a raised part of the shoulder plate his suit badly damaged and its flight capabilities were clearly non-functional. The blood coming from his mouth likely indicated he was seriously injured as well.

Suddenly, a massive object dropped into view - it was Peter's Mover extending its hand. Peter jumped onto it and turning back he could see Belloc still staring at him as he fell into the flaming mass of metal imploding on itself.

The surviving Mover coiled its arm back keeping Peter away from the destruction. It swung its other arm high into the air and brought it down across its opponent's now slack head.

The defeated giant began a slow twirl, collapsing, collapsing, collapsing. As it hit the ground massive explosions erupted and Peter's Mover took several steps back as a mighty fireball consumed the titan and Belloc.

Peter stood on the open palm as the Mover steadied itself. He suddenly felt weak in his legs as the full weight of what just happened rushed into his adrenaline-filled brain.

Falling forward, he caught himself on his hands and knees. Numbness swamped his body and he ached everywhere.

"Peter."

It was Millie's voice but it sounded like it was from underwater, far away but recognizable.

"Peter, it's over."

Things began to clear and he remembered where he was. He pushed himself up to sit on his heels.

"You will now become the Proctor."

Now he was unexpectedly at ease despite the prospect of his position remaining incredibly daunting. Millie materialized next to him at half size.

"You will have untold responsibility and far greater hardships than even this are undoubtedly ahead but you are now ready and have found your place in this world."

Peter stood.

"You are now truly knowing of your mantle and are donning it triumphant."

_Epilogue_

Immediately following the defeat of Belloc, Peter broadcast a message to all of ITAM & Co. announcing his assumption to the post of the Proctor and the defeat of Dr. Belloc. Arrest orders were issued for More and Lewis was also detained as part of an immediate cessation of hostilities.

After the war, ITAM & Co. received several major sanctions from several governments and various oversight councils with leaders of the intra-company factions being brought before a tribunal for judgment. Lewis was found innocent as he fought to subdue the rebellion despite allowing the ITAM civil war to erupt \(often colloquially known as the "thirty-minute war"\) while other parties, including More, faced prison sentences. Peter officially assumed full control of the ITAM network and after a council with the various operational heads began restructuring the company.

Although he had nothing to do with actual start of the war, Peter as the "head" of ITAM & Co. received blame for his place in the conflict and as such chose to go into quasi-exile on the plains of _Pangea_ where he established a small hermitage to remotely and subtly conduct the business of managing the company's operations. Essentially, he was doing exactly what he was designed to do while remaining separate from the rest of the firm and the world.

On the day of his departure, Peter gave a short address to the small crowd of ITAM leaders there to see him off. It read:

"The world stands as a plane for man's self-creation. The field on which man answers the call to become mankind. Caked blood of martyrs and stinging sweat of the people stand witness to the pursuit of our destiny. But in our struggle we so often lose our perspective. I ask you, truthfully: are we to create a greater world for Man, or a greater Man for the world?"
