The sunlight was warm on Damien's face as he walked alongside Mr. Lewis who led the group through the city's streets.

"Proctor Hopeful," said Lewis to Damiano, "it's time you learned your place in this world."

His tone was that of a man forward in thought and in action - someone who didn't bother with secrets or procedure because he knew all of the secrets and dictated all of the procedure. Despite this, he did not project any arrogance or pride; he simply knew his position of responsibility and his own abilities to carry out his duties.

Passing through a tree-filled plaza, they walked by people moving about the city in a steady stream of activity. It was a bustling hub with a non-metropolitan feel - different from the rain-swept cityscape they'd just left.

Ignoring the others, Lewis continued addressing Damiano.

"I am the Chairman of ITAM and I am charged with the execution of ITAM's core mission - some of which may have already been told to you. I am ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the overall endeavor."

They turned down a thoroughfare lined with stores and open-air workshops.

"This construct," he said, gesturing towards their surroundings, "is a means for carrying forward that mission. It is a development sandbox where new projects, both ITAM-owned and externally sponsored, can be undertaken in an environment conducive to innovation."

"We are providing a conduit for their productivity and a means for them to build. The goal is not to fabricate a new world but to make the existing one better. And to that end, we seek to use all of the tools that help forward that mission and liberate productive output."

They arrived at a large, nearly windowless building and followed Lewis inside.
