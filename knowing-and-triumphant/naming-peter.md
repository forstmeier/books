"You will also have a name," it continued. "A great authority is within you and it will know your true name."

Simon rose along the wall and the primary orb looked over Damiano's head towards the ceiling as if in thought. Every piece on the wall was moving with slight agitation as the apparatus sunk deep into thought. Instinctively, Damien knelt before the machine, waiting.

Then, Simon spoke.

"Henceforth, your name and being shall be...Peter."

The newly-named Peter suddenly felt what could only be described as a sharp click and hum inside his head and a white light shot through his mind and vision. A feeling of weightlessness overwhelmed him for a moment before reality rushed back in upon him. He fell sideways, only just catching himself before he fell, and breathing heavily he looked up at Simon who was regarding him carefully.

The apparatus relaxed again into an ambient state.

His mind felt...liberated as if it had somehow just been unbound, as if there were more knowledge that had not been their prior. But he couldn't access it - it was as if he were struggling to remember something he had only just forgot. He straightened up to face Simon again.

"I am Peter."

"Rise."

Peter slowly stood, and Damien fell away.

"From this point forward, you are hereby charged with the rights and duties of the Office of the Proctor. However, until that time when you are fully inducted into the role, you will remain Proctor Hopeful to the outside world. There is much yet that must occur before you attain your full potential as the Proctor of ITAM."

Leaning forward from the wall, Simon spoke, "You have been named but you have yet to accept your title."

Before Peter could get clarification there was a commotion from outside the door. Both turned as the door whisked open and Lewis stepped through.

In his now-gloved hand was a pistol.

Simon regarded him smoothly.

"Recognized: Oliver Lewis, Chairman of ITAM."

Without saying a word, Lewis raised his other hand which held a small cylindrical device and pointing it towards Simon he clicked a button. There was a quick flash and then all of Simon's pieces froze in place - the light from his photoreceptor dimmed.

He turned back to Peter.

"We're leaving."
