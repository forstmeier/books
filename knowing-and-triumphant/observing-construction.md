Their surroundings gradually became a white sand desert and the billowy green grasslands fell away behind them. It was a nearly completely empty expanse with mountains, proper mountains, far off in the distance. Beautiful, vast, empty. Eventually, a shape began to materialize in the distance ahead of them.

Peter stood and walked to the very bow of the skiff. A little shiver of excitement ran down his spine. Despite the present situation, it was exhilarating hurtling along and seeing the world unfold before them. There was something utterly visceral about the feeling, something almost out-of-body.

The shape they were approaching grew in size but its outline was constantly changing. Soon it became apparent that it was a massive wall of dust rising up from the ground. Again, Arthur began to slow their craft and gently guide it higher up and over the spectacle unfolding below them.

It was a massive construction zone with hundreds of figures toiling on the ground in a large line. Humans, robots, machines, all working amidst perpetual clouds of chalk-ish white dust thrown up by their work. Through the great din of their work another noise could be heard rising from the site. It was measured and coordinated, voices raised together in harmony.

"What is that?" he asked Lewis.

"Singing" the chairman responded with a smile.

Peaceful and melodious, smooth and measured. It sounded like nothing and everything. Somehow reaching to heaven yet knowing it deserved nothing.

"Down there they are actually in the process of building the world we're flying over."

Peering down through the cloud, Peter could see that was the case. Some of the figures were pouring out sand from great containers, extending the desert that they had been flying over. Other guided a massive slab of what appeared to be rock into place.

"That is part of the upper layer of the construct's terrestrial floor," explained Lewis pointing at the great piece of earth. "_Pangea_ does not have a fully, truly natural planetary body but we have taken steps to recreate the very upper mantle and crust sections."

"The bottom layers a pseudo-mantle, which you can actually observe from the underside of the structure, which simulates a natural planet even though it's not a full system. Layers of the crust are hand-made at this point as you can see below," he said as he gestured at the crews toiling away below them.

"The dirt, and rocks, and soil, and even the flora and fauna have been synthesized using material from Earth and material harvested from other entities such as planets and asteroids. It's not a truly unique "DNA" for _Pangea_," admitted Lewis, "but it is pretty close."

Lewis looked over the edge with a look of contentment on his face. For a moment, Peter thought he was pleased as if this was all his work but then he realized it was something else. It was the look of someone admiring another's work, appreciating it. Appreciating the effort that was exerted to bring it into being. Pride and admiration. Not only for those who envisioned and lead this undertaking, but the very workers putting the world together beneath their very feet.
