Soon they began their descent through the atmosphere with more geographic features becoming increasingly clear. Cities were scattered about the surface but were few and far between; other spaceships and airships could be seen flitting about.

"That ahead is the city of Hua," said Arthur pointing beyond the viewport.

The city's buildings and towers were sleek but simple; it's layout and design indicated one of a well-developed metropolis while still maintaining a feeling of rugged pioneering. As they coasted over the cityscape, lush trees and well-kept parks and streets opened up; figures and vehicles were visible moving about beneath them. The ship began to descend towards a landing pad in the middle of the city.

"Come" instructed Dr. Belloc and they moved back into the entrance foyer as the other passengers began to congregate around them.

More came out of a side hallway and smiled at Damiano as she took a place standing next to him. After a few moments, there was a soft bump as the landing gear hit the ground and the engines gave off a muffled whine while they powered down. The hatch slowly dropped open and the landing board extended down to the platform. Damien followed Belloc and More out of the ship and into the warm sunlight.
