Peter steadied himself as he took in the scene before him.

The two great beings were locked in combat. He felt a shiver run down his neck; he could imagine the great choruses of humanity resting in the balance of this combat, watching and raising their voices in great song. Another massive strike swung in from Belloc's Mover and the "ground" beneath them lurched sideways. It slid freely under Peter's feet for a moment and he had to catch himself again.

Regaining his footing, he ran forward along the great, sloping plate. As the downturn curvature increased he dropped into a controlled slide downward along the plates' surface. He dropped onto a small extended piece of the shell and propped himself against the steep slope of the armor, now a wall behind him.

"Focus" spoke Millie in his ear, "I'll help you direct a blast."

Peter stared across at the opposing titan. He raised his hand, palm out and fingers extended. Holograms began appearing and enveloping his outstretched hand and wrist. A shiver went down his spine for a split second. Electricity began coursing down his arm and through his hand and then it released.

Great bolts shot from his fingertips, not unlike Lewis's from earlier, but without the aid of the gauntlets and much more powerful. Thick tendrils of blue-white light cascaded across the distance and slammed into the upper shoulder of the opposing giant. An explosion erupted at the point of impact and smoke rose from the blast wound like weightless blood.

"AGAIN!" shouted Millie excitedly.

Peter focused again and another torrent of lightning streamed out from his hand, this time to strike the central armor chest plate. Millie was shouting wildly in his helmet from excitement.

Its head rotated and giant eyes came to focus on him, the source of its annoyance. A massive hand swung towards Peter's location; he braced for launch against the plate behind him.

"NOW!" shouted Millie.

Peter leaped forward propelled by a telekinetic blast. His helmet snapped into place as his boosters fired quickly accelerating him out of the way of the incoming blow which connected with the Proctor Mover, missing Peter.

But Belloc was no longer concerned with that giant - his focus was totally on Peter and he began pivoting his Mover in an attempt to keep the small flying figure in view. Zipping higher out of reach, Peter cut the power to his boosters and felt Millie helping him focus yet another blast.

"Ready" she clipped in his ear.

Another blast - this one connected with the side of the Mover's head but it still managed to swing at Peter who popped out of the way of the lumbering arm.

Swooping up and around, he wrung his brain for his next move.

The current situation was only a brief stalemate. He couldn't defeat his enemy using the Proctor Mover, it would soon be overrun. He couldn't destroy it from his flying vantage point, he didn't have the power and even if he did, the circling gunboats would certainly move in, likely with more reinforcements and overwhelm him. Something had to change.
