From behind his tree, Arthur continued exchanging fire with More's group, and Peter could see the tree he was using was riddled with scorch marks from their blasts. The open square behind them was a wall for all intents and purposes and they were backed up against it.

Suddenly, an explosion blew apart one of More's positions. Pieces of ground and wall were thrown up into the air. Peter and Arthur turned and looked up to see where the projectile had come from only to see Lewis flying towards them propelled by a backpack and boots like the equipment that Peter was wearing.

Sweeping by in a great swoop, he fired a stream of laser blasts down on More's party as well as another torent of lightning on an unlucky position. More and her men ducked for cover and began firing at the airborne Lewis.

Several soldiers lifted off of the ground with their own flying equipment to take the fight to the sky. The aerial combatants all left white whispy wakes that partially engulfed their lower bodies and quickly dissipated in the air behind them.

Capitalizing on the distraction Millie shouted to Peter, "MOVE!"

Peter and Arthur began running across the open square. More quickly noticed and directed several robots to begin firing on the retreating pair.

Millie spoke in Peter's ear, "Activate the propulsion system! You'll be able to control it via your neural interface."

Ahead of him mid-stride, Arthur jumped into the air as his flight systems ignited.

Peter's own boosters ignited and a helmet unfolded from his armor, snapping into position about his head. Instinctively, he leaned forward and took off skimming close to the ground. He coul feel the system controls, rather than seeing anything, in his mind - the computers balancing the load and propulsion, continuous diagnostic checks, backup systems, fuel consumption and burn rates. Everything was there in his mind. It was more a sensation more like hearing or touch rather than visually observing it but it was all just as detailed as if he were reading it from a screen.

He rapidly picked up speed crossing the square and More's group and the dueling Lewis were receding behind them. They were hard-pressed dealing with the surprisingly nimble and well-equipped Lewis who was clearly adept at handling himself in this situation. Peter followed Arthur as he arched up and over the surrounding buildings.
