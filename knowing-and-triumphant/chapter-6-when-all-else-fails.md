Peter snapped back into consciousness, gasping in shock.  

His heart was racing in his chest.  

The last thing he remembered was...the needles...the procedure.  

He forced himself to take a deep breath, and then another. Gradually, his body calmed down and he began to take in where he was. It was a different room from where the operation had taken place; there was no constant, almost imperceptible, low hum of the systems on _Lunella_ so he must be back on _Pangea_.  

Sitting up, he looked about the dimly lit room. He was on a hospital-style bed but there was no equipment about. The medical gown he wore to the operation was gone and he was now dressed in a gray, fitted bodysuit and light shoes. One door was open in the room and it led down a hallway lit by faint white lights.  

Peter slid from the bed and walked carefully down the hall. At the end was a small room and in the center stood a full suit of combat armor behind a plated glass display case.  

A side door opened and Arthur stepped through. He was wearing combat armor with several plats and pieces of equipment strapped to his metal frame.  

"Hello, sir, how are you feeling?" asked Arthur, cheerful as always.  

"I'm okay. A little sore though."  

"That is to be expected given the arduous procedure," said Arthur matter-of-factly. "It should wear off in time and I should warn you that you may now begin experiencing your previously dormant capabilities as the Proctor."  

Arthur tapped a holographic panel next to the display case which slid up and away into the ceiling. He stepped forward and began retrieving pieces from the set.  

"This is for you, sir" proffering them to Peter.  

"Why?"  

The concern in his voice must have shown through as Arthur changed his tone to a more reassuring one.  

"You are in no immediate danger, this is merely a precaution that has been ordered for you."  

"By whom?"  

Arthur paused in assembling Peter's armor briefly before responding.  

"Unfortunately, sir, I am unable to divulge that at this time."  

Peter didn't need him to say the name. Of course, he already knew who it was. The puppet master behind every curtain. He shook his head as if to clear it and followed Arthur's directions to begin donning the suit.  

Peter looked down at the assembled suit of armor he was wearing. It consisted of several plated segments primarily covering the torso and shoulders with plates protecting the limbs. The armored boot legs had some pipe-like equipment for an unknown purpose attached to them, as did his gauntlets and back.  

"Again" spoke Arthur, "this is a defensive measure for use only in the event of an emergency. There is no need to be concerned."  

"Too late", Peter muttered to himself.  

"Are you ready, sir?"  

Peter nodded in affirmation.  

Arthur led them down a series of hallways and stairways until they came to a high-ceiling conference room and entered through the only door. A large chandelier hung above the long table filling the majority of the room.  

At the far end sat Lewis by himself.  

He was sitting passively in dark robes with his hands folded in his lap below the table; he seemed to be deep in thought with his head slightly bowed.  

To one side stood More with a small contingent of armed soldiers. Now she was also wearing armor, similar to the light construction of Peter's. A helmet was cradled in the crook of her arm and her hair was now pulled back into two buns low on her head as if ready for action.  

She smiled faintly at Peter as he entered and took up a place standing across the table from her.  

Millie materialized over Peter's shoulder as if to assure him of her presence while Arthur took up a position on his other side.  

"How do you feel, Peter? Are you okay?" asked More breaking the silence.  

"Yes. It hurt but I'm okay now."  

More gave Peter another weak smile.  

"I'm glad that part is over."  

"We're taking you to the battleship _Thulcandra_ to begin your work."  

"I thought I would be completing _Pangea_ and worming from the _Arbiter_ first" said Peter in surprise.  

More glanced at Lewis.  

"No, the proper location is on board the _Thulcandra_ - more versitile and more mobile. It's ideal for your mission. Peter, you MUST come with me - our world, our people, need this from you."  

Silently, Peter looked down at the table.  

"You MUST come, Peter. We cannot let you go otherwise."  

Her tone was increasingly pleading, bordering on demanding. She was effectively calling for Peter's submission. He still wanted desperately to trust her; he couldn't bear to lose that friend, that mother figure in his new life.  

A sinking feeling, one that engulfed everything, came to swallow him whole. He didn't want to swim away - he wanted it to consume him and make all of this disappear.  

Before he could speak, there was a sudden commotion in the hallway. A moment later another group stepped through the sole doorway, similarly armed and led by a man older than More and Lewis who had a haughty look about him. His face bore a scowl of anger that looked almost permanent as he surveyed the scene before him in the room.  

"By order of the Oversight Committee, I demand that all of you stand down," he ordered loudly.  

"Mr. Card, welcome. As you can see, we have Lewis in custody," said More by way of introduction. She seemed prepared for his arrival. Card gave her a disdainful look before turning his gaze down the table at the still-seated Lewis. "Finally," said Card with a look of satisfaction. "You could not outrun the Oversight Committee forever. Or even for a day it seems."  

"Hello, Leopold," said Lewis raising his head for the first time. "How are you this fine morning?"  

"You will address me as Chairman," spat Card contemptuously. "You are a traitor and I want to never have known you."  

But Lewis pressed on ignoring Card's comments.  

"Before you arrived, Alexandra here was laying out her plans to install the Proctor on board battleship _Thulcandra_ - it's an interesting suggestion, what do you think?"  

Card turned on More aghast. "What? Your private ship? I demand an explaination!" he blustered out.  

"Given the circumstances" responded More smoothly "it seemed like a necessary precaution and one we should stick with until we know the level of his manipulation" she said gesturing at Lewis.

"Nonsense. The crisis is over. We go back to the original project specifications."  

"I must insist, Chairman."  

Her tone was now commanding and a quiet fell on the room. Card turned fully to face her.  

"How DARE you countermand the binding orders of ITAM!" shouted Card, his voice choked in fury. "Who are you to change the course of history set before us?!"  

"I dare because it is our only course of action. We cannot leave to chance the danger of this man's schemings, blatant manipulation, and destructive actions. He destroyed The Machine, he stole the Proctor hopeful."  

More braced herself.  

"Orders have been issued by the Executive Leadership initiating the contingency plan that removes the Oversight Committee due to an unfitness for command."  

The two individuals faced off.  

Card fuming, ready to burst. More coiled, prepared to spring.  

The tension in the room was palpable. A man bound by his mission, a woman driven by purpose.  

"Alexandra is right to be concerned. But perhaps I can shed some light on the situation" spoke Lewis from his far end of the table. The holoprojector in the middle of the table lit up and before the stunned audience, the image of Simon floated above the table.  

"An attempt to seize control of the Proctor, once so much power and authority was endowed in a single individual was inevitable so I set plans in motion to ensure his rightful ascension."  

"I didn't know who the conspirators would be so I made myself the target to draw the attention of the Oversight Committee. I only guess that it was More and Belloc in the past few days. Additionally, I knew that the Proctor would need to be brought here, to _Pangea_, to complete his installation. My incapacitation of The Machine was planned because had he had been operational, he would have been a target of the conspirators knowing he wouldn't allow a manipulation of the Proctor's position to occur. It also gave him cover to provide my cover while I...met...with the Proctor."

"And all of that leads us to this...rather uncomfortable situation."

The hologram of Simon floated forward slightly. Simon spoke in his harsh, mechanical voice, "I can confirm these statements made by Chairman Lewis. Additionally, he has provided me with his private journals and logs of actions taken by the conspirators."  

Holographic documents and notes rapidly appeared in succession above the table. It was all as Lewis had said.  

Card turned on More in a fury.  

"This is an absolute outrage!" he bellowed. "We will get to the bottom of this!."  

He spun back to Lewis.  

"None of this absolves you from the investigation and you will be detained until further notice for your part in the manipulation of this project! Issue a warrant for the arrest of Dr. Belloc; Ms. More, I order you to stand down and surrender immediately."  

A smile appeared on More's face; it was sardonic and conveyed no happiness. The look on her face was so different from what Peter had seen before. This was the cold and calculating side of the woman. No longer did she appear as the loving mother and life-giver - she was now a ruthless killer.  

"No," she said firmly. "We will be continuing our mission whether or not you support it. The good of all is at stake and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that we succeed."  

The full declaration had been made and the glove had been thrown down. More nodded to her combat retinue. They raised their weapons and some stepped forward towards Lewis while the rest formed up facing Card's forces.  

"Seize them!" shouted Card.  

Card's soldiers stepped forwards towards More and Peter - More and her faction raised their weapons. At that moment, Lewis stood up revealing large metal gauntlets on his hands. They must have been placed there by Arthur in anticipation of this moment.  

Before anyone could blink he whipped his hands forward and a torrent of thick lightning bolts flew from his outstretched fingers. There was a thunderous blast as the cascading energy tore into More and Card's respective groups. Some were quick enough to duck behind chairs while body proximity shields embedded in their armor appeared to protect others. The blasts were so powerful soldiers were thrown back against the far wall.  

With the opposition briefly ducking for cover, Lewis halted the blinding stream and before they could regain their balance, and without pausing threw his hands back behind him as if slapping something away from him. His hands generated a strong kinetic blast which smashed through the wall behind him and through the dust Peter could see the outside air.  

"Go," said Lewis, his eyes focused on his targets across the table.  

Arthur leaped towards the opening and shouted to Peter, "Follow me!"  

Peter followed without even thinking. Bounding through the dust he leaped straight into thin air.  

For a brief moment, he was suspended midair before gravity again pulled him down. His stomach lurched as he plummeted but his mind was strangely calm. He landed on a building below and raced off across the rooftops hot on Arthur's heels.  

Suddenly, an explosion erupted, tearing apart the room they were just in. The two skidded to a brief stop but then Arthur immediately began running again. Debris fell everywhere about them as they sped along - it smelled like burnt plaster.  

They quickly made their way to ground level and sprinted along the street circling around the tower complex they had exited towards the nearest landing pad. Out of nowhere, More and her cadre burst onto the scene before them bringing Arthur and Peter to a halt.  

"OPEN FIRE!" ordered More.  

Now her mission was to incapacitate or perhaps even kill them; she was too far committed now to turn back. Peter wondered how she had managed to survive the conference room blast as he followed Arthur diving for cover.  

They began running between trees along the walkway with Arthur now brandishing a pistol with which he would periodically twist mid-run to return fire at their pursuers. Millie, who had disappeared as they exited the conference room, reappeared and called out incoming blasts and pointed out cover as they ran, helping as best she could as the firefight continued.  

The three sprinted down a side alleyway which brought them to an open square. There was little cover beyond the trees ringing the plaza and they would not be able to cross it without being picked off. Their pursuers quickly moved to block any chance of circling the square while using the surrounding trees as cover.  

They were pinned down.  

Suddenly, an explosion blew apart one of More's positions. Peter and Arthur looked up to see Lewis flying towards them propelled by a backpack and boots like the equipment that Peter was wearing. Swooping past, he delivered a barrage of laser blasts and lightning bolts on the attackers.  

Capitalizing on the distraction Millie shouted to Peter, "MOVE!"  

Peter and Arthur began running across the open square. More quickly noticed and directed several robots to begin firing on the retreating pair.  

Millie spoke in Peter's ear, "Activate the propulsion system! You'll be able to control it via your neural interface."  

Ahead of him mid-stride, Arthur jumped into the air as his flight systems ignited.  

Peter's own boosters ignited and a helmet unfolded from his armor, snapping into position about his head. Instinctively, he leaned forward and took off skimming close to the ground. He could feel the system controls, rather than seeing anything, in his mind.  

He rapidly picked up speed crossing the square and More's group and the dueling Lewis were receding behind them. They were hard-pressed dealing with the surprisingly nimble and well-equipped Lewis who was clearly adept at handling himself in this situation. Peter followed Arthur as he arched up and over the surrounding buildings.  

The full city was visible. It was in chaos.

Card had apparently brought a full military contingent with him when he arrived on _Pangea_ and it was in armed combat with More and Belloc's forces. He had been prepared for the worst which was now realized.  

Open conflict stretched across the Scholl cityscape. Smoke was rising from various blocks and there were explosions and laser blasts throughout the streets. Above them, ships and gunboats were suspended in air trading fire. Even further up still, in the high reaches of the atmosphere, small capital ships were visible engaging one another. More and Belloc clearly had great influence if they could muster resources to combat Card like this.  

It was a civil war within ITAM & Co. Conducted on the surface of its greatest physical creation. Humanity could never escape its scars because it was always the one to inflict them.  

The pair ducked and dodged among the buildings as their pursuers, who had finally lifted off from the square, fell into chase behind them. Five flying robots now pursued the two escapees. Peter couldn't see what had happened to Lewis but he had proven himself a supreme strategist at the very least.  

"I am to bring you to the _Arbiter_," shouted Arthur. "Your installation is to take place at any cost."  

They veered sharply to the side as two dueling gunboats dropped through the air in front of them.  

Following Arthur's lead, they cut out across the burning city, which felt a great deal like a smaller version of Hua and zipped out over the landscape beyond the outer limits. Their robot pursuers followed them doggedly.  

Keeping low to the ground, the pursued cut in and out of what little cover that could be found in the grassland.  

Following behind in a resolute line, the pursuers were gradually making up the distance between them and would periodically fire on them when they had the chance. Millie continued to provide updates while helping to optimize his flight systems and speed.  

"INCOMING ROCKET!" she shouted. An RPG fired by one of their pursuers whisked past them as they twisted out of the way. The projectile exploded a short distance in front of them and they swerved to avoid the blast.  

Arthur swung out in a wide arc close to the ground while Peter shot straight upwards. Three robots broke off to pursue Arthur while the remaining two followed Peter higher.  

"Cut all thruster power on the count of three," said Millie in his ear, her voice full of energy.  

Peter could feel the wind pressing against him as they rose faster and faster.  

"One..."  

Insanity.  

"Two..."  

Definitely don't look down.  

"Three!"  

The propulsors halted and Peter rapidly lost his upward momentum. He tilted backward in a somersault; now he was looking straight down - from a dizzyingly high point. He barely had time to register the ridiculous situation as his pursuers were ascending on his position too quickly.  

They attempted to slow their climb but in doing so they brought themselves off balance.  

"GAUNTLETS, NOW!" screamed Millie.  

Peter raised his hand towards the first of the robots - he felt a trigger pull in his mind. A small rocket tore from his wrist and blew apart the attacker's face just feet away.  

The other spun off above and behind him but was still close by. It caught itself quickly and wheeled around as if it were skating on an invisible wall with its propulsors.  

Its uplifted face angled down towards Peter keeping him in complete focus, looking directly at him, with nothing but its grim, robotic intent behind its photoreceptors.  

"Alright, you got this," said Millie in his ear.  

Blades appeared out of the robot's gauntlets. They looked holographic but more "solid", like a physical light projected and held in place. It was coming for an in-person kill.  

The robot sprang towards him closing the gap between them in a split second. At the last moment, a fraction of a second, Peter materialized a blade of his own from his wrist. With a tiny jet blast, he twisted to the side and swinging his blade out in a great loop he slashed across his opponent's arm. The limb fell off into space as the now one-armed robot spun to regain its position as it dropped past Peter.  

Without warning, its body burst into pieces and through the fireball flew Arthur up and past the suspended Proctor.  

"We must keep moving," said Arthur in haste. "Reinforcements are on their way."  

From their vantage point, they could see several ships approaching them from far off in the distance.  

"This way," said Arthur and again they were speeding off across the landscape.  

Soon a shape appeared ahead of them on the horizon. Gradually it formed into a giant walking bipedal outline. The _Arbiter_. Its blue and white paint scheme stood out against the green and brown landscape. As it trudged towards them, Peter could finally see just how truly massive it was.  

But when they got closer, another shape was visible not too far off. A second Mover. This one did not bear the markings of the Proctor. And it was making a bee-line for the _Arbiter_.  

It was there for him.  

Peter was sick to his stomach. There would be a literal titanic fight between the two giants.  

He followed Arthur to the chest of the behemoth. Arthur pulled back and motioned Peter forward towards a port on the chest. As he floated closer he opened the door without thinking, ducking in through the hatch into a small airlock big enough to stand in. His propulsors cut as he stepped onto the floor as naturally as if he were descending stairs.  

None of this registered; his mind was a singular focus.  

His induction as the Proctor would be a baptism of blood. His ascension would be seen only in his victory. There was no more running.  

He was going to have to fight.
