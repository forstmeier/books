Peter turned back to the viewscreen before him and began marching towards the oncoming giant. He reached out through the network trying to ascertain who his opponent was, who he was up against. He shivered. The presence on the other side was unmistakable.

It was Belloc.

He must have left to seize his Mover while More had been confronting them at Scholl to establish a fallback in the event they needed a last-ditch defense. If they weren't able to control the Proctor they would intercept and destroy the connection to the network. Peter sensed that Belloc and More still hoped only to apprehend him but were resolved to use lethal force if necessary.

The massive entities lumbering towards each other were rapidly closing the distance. At the same time, Peter could feel that the robot intruders were near at hand.

But before him, the battle had begun.

Belloc's Mover was now within striking distance. It swung a massive blow towards Peter. He braced himself on his command platform and raised his arm in defense - the platform and the holograms swirled around him, adjusting to his input.

His Mover raised its arm to counter but the blow still glanced off its head. The room lurched to the side from the impact. Peter stepped with the hit into a shallow crouch and in one smooth motion straightened up and threw a punch straight forward. Belloc sidestepped but still received a glancing blow of his own from the retaliatory strike.

Without stopping, Peter threw his other fist forward but the punch was caught in Belloc's outstretched palm. The other arm swung into view.

Peter raised his free hand to guard but his lumbering counterpart only partially managed to block the oncoming strike. Again, the room jolted heavily. Stumbling backward, Peter raised his hands defensively, struggling to maintain balance.

Belloc pressed the attack. His Mover jumped, or as close to jumping as these giants could come, towards Peter throwing one-two punches. Peter's outstretched arms blocked the blows and he delivered a quick counter jab to the stomach which slightly unbalanced Belloc. But the jab had brought Peter in close and he failed to notice Belloc's hand raised high into the air.

It came smashing down on his head. The entire command room dropped on the impact and Peter would have been thrown from his command platform had it not adjusted to keep him locked in.
