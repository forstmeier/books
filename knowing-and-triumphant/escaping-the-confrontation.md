For a brief moment, he was suspended midair before gravity again pulled him down. His stomach lurched as he plummeted but his mind was strangely calm. He landed on a building below and raced off across the rooftops hot on Arthur's heels.

Suddenly, an explosion erupted, tearing apart the room they were just in. The two skidded to a brief stop but then Arthur immediately began running again. Debris fell everywhere about them as they sped along - it smelled like burnt plaster.

They quickly made their way to ground level and sprinted along the street circling around the tower complex they had exited towards the nearest landing pad. Out of nowhere, More and her cadre burst onto the scene before them bringing Arthur and Peter to a halt.

"OPEN FIRE!" ordered More.

Now her mission was to incapacitate or perhaps even kill them; she was too far committed now to turn back. Peter wondered how she had managed to survive the conference room blast as he followed Arthur diving for cover.

They began running between trees along the walkway with Arthur now brandishing a pistol with which he would periodically twist mid-run to return fire at their pursuers. Millie, who had disappeared as they exited the conference room, reappeared and called out incoming blasts and pointed out cover as they ran, helping as best she could as the firefight continued.

The three sprinted down a side alleyway which brought them to an open square. There was little cover beyond the trees ringing the plaza and they would not be able to cross it without being picked off. Their pursuers quickly moved to block any chance of circling the square while using the surrounding trees as cover.

They were pinned down.
