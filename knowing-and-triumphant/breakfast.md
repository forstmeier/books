When Damien woke it was still dark outside - the storm from the night before had not completely passed and he could see raindrops faintly falling onto the bedroom window. After washing and dressing he walked with Arthur down the hallway to the dining room.

Breakfast was waiting for him, as were More and Belloc, cheerful and silent, respectively. More made small talk and kept Damiano in good company while Dr. Belloc seemed content with his cup of coffee and hand tablet all the while keeping a watchful eye on the pair.

"Well," said More as they finished, "we need to get moving if we're going to keep our schedule." A small group of attendants and robots entered from the opposite hallway carrying various pieces of equipment and luggage. Belloc began directing them about as More turned to Damiano. "We have a short bit of travel ahead of us - are you ready to go?"

"Yes, I am!" said Damiano.

"Great!" laughed More. "It looks like Dr. Belloc has everything prepared for departure so let's get a move on." With that she strode out of the room beckoning Damien to join her; the retinue fell in behind them.
