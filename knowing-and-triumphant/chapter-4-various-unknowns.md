Peter stood, stunned, staring at the now motionless Simon fixed to his wall.  

Lewis grabbed his arm and pulled him back into the antechamber. Four robots were there standing to attention in a square formation - their tall, slim bodies were covered in combat armor and in their hands were various weapons. They were apparently some sort of escort.  

The door into the outer room was shut and had an additional security door in place sealing the way in. A muffled banging could be heard from the other side and Peter's heart leaped into his mouth when he made out More's voice attempting to shout through the barricade.  

Without acknowledging the stifled commotion, Lewis guided Peter through a door, previously concealed, off to the side of the room which led to a long, dimly lit and unfinished hallway. Lewis's rapid pace increased to a steady jog forcing Peter to begin running to keep up.  

His heart was beating through his throat, his stomach was lurching about in a jumbled mess. Where Lewis was leading them was a mystery as were his plans for Peter. The pistol was still gripped in his hand. They hurried down the corridor.  

Just then, an explosion tore apart the hallway before them and through the smoke stepped More. Peter's heart leaped when he saw her.  

In a brief beat, she and Lewis made eye contact. Swiftly grabbing Peter's arm he turned to go down yet another side hallway.  

"STOP!" screamed More as she lurched forward.  

Just as calmly as he had lashed out at Simon, Lewis raised his pistol and began firing down the corridor at More. She and the troops following her dove for cover. The four robots of Lewis's escort stepped forward and took up positions along the walls firing on More's group. Flashing colors and bits of debris flew everywhere as the firefight erupted. Lasers flashed between the dueling factions. A cacophony of loud bangs and zaps filled the air as Peter was escorted roughly from the battle.  

Lewis rushed Peter through the hallway, closing and sealing each door they passed through. Finally, they reached the end and found themselves on a small, concealed landing dock. Parked in the middle was an open-aired skiff floating gently above the ground with Arthur waiting patiently behind the controls for them to arrive.  

Peter hoped that More was unhurt from the skirmish.  

"Take off."  

"Yes sir, at once," replied the robot and the ship rose swiftly into the air.  

Peter looked back and as he did small figures burst out of Simon's building and he could just barely make out Belloc's rigid figure staring helplessly as the skiff disappeared into the distance. Buildings and towers whisked by as they skimmed low over the cityscape which quickly gave way to wide open grassland as they passed over the outskirts. Arthur gunned the engines into high gear and they shot out across the landscape.  

Several minutes of silence followed; Peter could only stare at the man responsible for his abduction. The jumbled sickness he felt in his stomach was joined by a fiery heat of rage. The silence continued for a few moments as Peter worked up the composure to speak.  

"Take me back!" shouted Peter.  

Millie materialized over his shoulder.  

"Chairman if I might-"  

"No, you may not," he responded without looking up from his work.  

Millie opened her mouth as if to reply but before she could speak, Lewis raised his hand and her mouth closed again silently. He had remotely muted her program. Turning to Peter she raised her eyebrows, her attempt to interject on his behalf stifled.  

"Bring me back," demanded Peter. Despite his best efforts, his voice wobbled somewhat as he spoke.  

"No."  

Peter spun to face the ship's helm.  

"Arthur, where are we going?!"  

"I'm very sorry, sir," the robot responded, "I'm under orders to refrain from informing you as to our destination yet."  

Had Arthur been his secret guard the entire time? Peter stood in silence suddenly realizing he was quite cold from the rushing wind. Arthur approached and held out a cloak more suited to the temperature.  

"Here you are, sir."  

Peter looked up and snatched the coat from his hands donning it quickly.  

"I truly am sorry that I can't be of more help at this time. Hopefully, everything is resolved soon and satisfactorily by the time we arrive at our destination."  

He returned to the controls. Even though he was clearly working on behalf of Lewis, Arthur did not seem to harbor any malcontent towards Peter. Arthur was certainly treating him as if he were still his attendant.  

"Beautiful, isn't it?"  

Peter whipped around to find Lewis had come up behind him silently. He turned back to the landscape, attempting to ignore Lewis.  

"I want to be back with my friends."  

"I don't need you to be with your friends," responded Lewis. "I just need you to be where you need to be. And you need to be hear as we discuss your future," he said. "Millicent should be here as well." At that, Millie rematerialized over Peter's shoulder and despite the disappointed look on her face, she gave Peter an encouraging nod.  

Lewis sat in silence for a few moments thinking of what to say. When he finally spoke, his tone had become more "human" and less standoffish. It was as if he had removed some mask or persona and was speaking as himself for the first time. His voice was steady and warm. Still, every word had meaning and was delivered with precisely chosen intent as a man of conviction and vision.   

"I want to help you," he said earnestly. "A very great burden has been placed on you and right now you couldn't possibly understand its implications. I'm here to help you understand your place in this world."  

"If you're here to help, why are you attacking people and kidnapping me?"  

"Because it was necessary."

They fell silent for a while as the ship continued zipping across the terrain. Below them the grass-covered landscape rippled in the wind. A river cut through the windswept scene with the crystalline water falling through a rocky riverbed. In the distance, towering hills rose from the ground. It all felt ancient and storied despite it having been man-made not too long ago.  

Millie bent close to his ear and spoke softly. Peter had a passing thought that it was odd for her to do that, being a hologram and her vocal projection actually coming from the emitter pinned to his shoulder. She really had incredibly human-like mannerisms.  

"There's a communications blackout I can't break through," she reported. "It seems like Lewis has taken down the entire communication system at the hardware level. Because of that, I won't likely be able to get any sort of message out via direct means. I'll explore some of the unit-to-unit latent communication networks and see if that's a viable option."  

She continued wearily.  

"Unfortunately there does appear to be a highly powerful AI involved in that network for some reason and it's actively countering my attempts to access the system. There are only a handful of ITAM constructs capable of this level of defense as I'm quite literally hitting it with every resource I've got. It feels like I'm playing a chess match but instead of playing it on a board it's on a Rubix cube and the Rubix cube is fighting back."  

"Can I help?"  

She sighed.  

"Not yet, you can't," she responded almost wishfully.  

Lewis broke into their conversation. "Are you hungry?" he asked.

Peter nodded despite himself.

Lewis reached into a travel bag at his feet and produced several sealed ration packets. The two ate in silence while Lewis continued gazing across the landscape.

Suddenly Millie projected herself out and in front of Peter, increasing her projection size to one-half scale.  

"Alright, what is this all about?" she challenged. "And don't go waving your hand about - I took that little trick away so you might as well answer, you ass."  

Peter froze mid-chew at her point-blank question and waited for Lewis to answer. Millie stood there floating, hands akimbo glaring across at the chairman.  

Lewis continued passively chewing his meal, ignoring the angry AI.  

"Oh, real mature," she quipped. "You want to teach him about himself and expect that showing him the actions of a petulant child will really help him."  

"I'm not teaching him anything right now so I don't need to speak. You can interpret that as you will."  

"I damn well will interpret it that way" she retorted. "You seriously want us to believe what you say after holding us at gunpoint-"  

"I never held either of you at gunpoint," he interjected.  

"That's just because Peter never gave you a reason. And because shooting a hologram is the only dumber thing you could do at that moment."  

"Do you honestly think that I need a gun to forward this agenda?" he said, looking up from his food.  

Millie's face twisted into a frown of disapproval but she fell silent.  

Lewis went back to his food and Millie shrunk down to her previous size and gave Peter a little helpless shrug.  

Their surroundings gradually became a white sand desert and the billowy green grasslands fell away behind them. It was a nearly completely empty expanse with mountains, proper mountains, far off in the distance. Beautiful, vast, empty. Eventually, a shape began to materialize in the distance ahead of them.  

Peter stood and walked to the very bow of the skiff. A little shiver of excitement ran down his spine. Despite the present situation, it was exhilarating hurtling along and seeing the world unfold before them.  

The shape became a billowing dust cloud kicked up by a massive construction zone with hundreds of figures toiling on the ground in a large line. Humans, robots, machines, all working amidst perpetual clouds of chalk-ish white dust thrown up by their work. Through the great din of their work another noise could be heard rising from the site. It was measured and coordinated, voices raised together in harmony.  

"What is that?" he asked Lewis.  

"Singing" the chairman responded with a smile.  

Peaceful and melodious, smooth and measured. It sounded like nothing and everything. Somehow reaching to heaven yet knowing it deserved nothing.  

"Down there they are actually in the process of building the world we're flying over."  

Peering down through the cloud, Peter could see that was the case. Some of the figures were pouring out sand from great containers, extending the desert that they had been flying over. Other guided a massive slab of what appeared to be rock into place.  

"That's one of the great Movers," Millie said in a hushed tone pointing at a giant biped moving huge beams into place. "They're giant robots used in the production of large-scale construction projects. Most are currently being used to finish the frame of _Pangea_ in what remains of the unconstructed zones. The largest loads and adjustments, like pseudo-tectonic placements, are performed by the Movers."  

The Mover stood several times taller than the altitude they were currently flying at and had a large body and thick, trunk-like arms and legs. A disproportionately small head hunched into the machine's shoulders which were made up of large pauldron plates.  

"One of these is yours," said Millie.  

"What do you mean?" asked Peter, surprised.  

"She means that one of these is to be your base of operations," interjected Lewis. "Your first project will be overseeing the completion of _Pangea_."  

"It's actually quite a striking look, your Mover" added Millie. "Painted all white with blue markings and a giant Seal of the Proctor across its shoulder. It's called the _Arbiter_."  

Lewis looked over the edge with a look of contentment on his face. For a moment, Peter thought he was pleased as if this was all his work but then he realized it was something else. It was the look of someone admiring another's work, appreciating it. Appreciating the effort that was exerted to bring it into being. Pride and admiration. Not only for those who envisioned and lead this undertaking, but the very workers putting the world together beneath their very feet.  

The skiff drifted past the scene below them and onto the next. Before them was nothing but large, barren tracts of exposed metal framework arching away into the unbroken horizon. Was the atmosphere around them thinning? Or was it a lack of reflective surroundings to provide additional light? Either way, the enormous metal beams and troughs below them returned only a dull glint from the sun above which now appeared more like a dispassionate orb than a warming and sky-filling light.  

Lewis broke the silence.  

"We need to discuss your role in this world."  

Peter bristled remembering his circumstance.  

"I've already been told it by Simon."  

Lewis opened his mouth and then closed it taking a moment to formulate his response.  

"He's your older brother in many ways and yes he knows what you'll go through. But I am the one who knows why you are here and you are here because I ordered it."  

That was it. The kidnapping went well beyond any long-term plan that could have possibly been laid out. It had been the known and expected from the moment Peter was first dreamed up. The control the chairman had over him didn't stop at their present predicament. His grip reached into the very core of Peter's existence.  

Lewis seemed to sense Peter's disquiet and continued in a more comforting tone. "It wasn't on some whim, Peter."  

That was the first time Lewis had said his name. Until now it had been "Proctor Hopeful" or no name at all. That struck a chord with Peter, something personal. It was as if Lewis had very intentionally set aside his role as Chairman responsible for a project and finally approached him as a person.  

Lewis was leaning forward now, eyes fixed on Peter's. "There's more to you than simply fitting into Simon's role of managing ITAM. ITAM has an enormous presence in human affairs and it seeks to help all mankind."  

"This makes you a leader of men. That's a role no one is simply born into, no matter how much careful planning is put into their conception. No, that is something that is built on trial and error. You must learn your role through what only your human experience can afford you."  

Involuntarily, Peter began relax. Curiosity began to return seeing this great world unfold around him. Curiosity too about the things that Lewis was saying. Curiosity and nervousness at the immensity of the job being asked.  

"How will I know what the right thing to do is?" he asked weakly, almost to himself.  

Lewis stood up from his seat and walked to the bow. Looking over the emptiness he replied, "It is difficult to say. We live in a world of relativity. Different people with different experiences, choices, lives. Separately we are individuals but still bound by absolutes."  

He paused a moment.  

"I believe we live in a world where humans bear a set of intrinsic rights. One of the most important of these is the right of the individual to self-direction. Beings of reason demand freedom. Balancing this and other fundamental privileges can be difficult. It is hard enough for the individual in day-to-day life and it will be even greater in your role as your choices will envelope many lives. That question will arise every single day of your life."  

"Can your authority be wielded to end suffering and to provide structure to this world? Can those fundamental rights of freedom be sacrificed? You will have to answer these questions every day. Just like the rest of us."  

Lewis turned back to Peter who had been intently watching him as he stood looking across the landscape.  

"I did not put you here, into your position, lightly," he said with an earnest intonation, almost begging Peter to believe him. "I know that I'm asking the world of you."  

He was silent for a while before instructing Arthur to return them back to the land. Before long they again came to a grassland and a little further beyond they arrived at a small building. Upon disembarking and a closer inspection, it appeared to have been specifically prepared to accommodate visitors.  

Arthur set about cooking dinner on a compact mobile kitchen while Peter helped him fetch various utensils and ingredients. The robot chatted amiably but Peter remained mostly silent, still processing everything that had happened that day. After helping unpack, Lewis kept to himself and only observed their interactions from a distance. Once the meal was ready they ate in silence around the fire Lewis had lit.  

"May I take that?" asked Peter suddenly, pointing at a small grass skimmer hovering just off the ground anchored next to the house.  

Lewis nodded.  

Lewis had just given him a way out, a means of escape. Either that meant he trusted him now or there was no longer a reason for him to remain with Lewis. Likely the latter. And somehow, Peter wasn't really surprised by Lewis's response. He'd already known he would say yes. And he already knew he didn't want to try and escape.  

Sailing over the tall grass in the sunset gave him space to think. Stars began to appear in the brown sunset sky as the faintest beginnings of the eventual starfield that would unfold. It was all so crystal clear and untainted. Before long he came across a hydraulics hub protruding from the ground standing a few feet higher than the top of the grass and with enough room to lay down on.  

Millie appeared next to him as he sat down.  

"Busy day, huh?"  

Peter grunted in agreement.  

"Yes, it was. What do you think of it all?"  

Millie blew threw her cheeks. "It's a ridiculous game Lewis ran us through. I can't quite figure out what his intent is. He is following the core ITAM directives, that much is clear, but it also appears that he is in active conflict with the company's executives. Someone on the other end must have been able to reestablish the communications network because I was finally able to access it."  

"Just before you arrived on _Pangea_, Lewis was ordered off of his current assignment by a man named Card who is the Chairman of the Oversight Committee. He even went so far as to demand Lewis's arrest."  

"Well, in that last bit he said on our trip, he genuinely seemed to be trying to help me find my way."  

"Yes," said Millie. "And right now you could very easily pilot this skimmer off into the horizon and make our way back to the city. And he has given you that opportunity. So the period of detainment appears to be over."  

Peter thought for a moment.  

"I'll stay."  

Millie nodded.  

"Okay. Then I'm staying with you. No matter what happens."  

The two of them sat in silence for another hour or so before boarding the skimmer and returning back to the lodge. Lewis was already asleep, or at least appeared to be, in one of the wall bunk alcoves when they arrived. Arthur was standing in resting mode off in a corner but re-activated as they entered.  

He stepped forward and helped Peter prepare for bed. "I hope you can understand my position, sir, and accept my apology for the actions I was under orders to execute today."  

"I do, Arthur, and thank you."  

Although his face was expressionless, Peter almost sensed a relieved and happy smile on the robot's metal face.  

"Good night, sir."  

"Good night, Arthur."  

Peter was still very unsure of Lewis but he was no longer outright nervous. While his true motives were unclear, it was apparent he was in no immediate danger. And in that state of mind, Peter drifted off into sleep.
