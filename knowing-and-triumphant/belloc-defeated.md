Planting his foot, he pressed back up against Belloc releasing their deadlock. He extended his hand pushing Belloc away with a telekinetic blast. But the doctor caught himself and shot a blast of lightning at Peter who deflected it away with his sword. Again he fired and again Peter blocked it.

A miniature tornado of fire appeared around Belloc's free arm from the combination of his flame thrower and telekinetic weaponry, quickly growing in intensity and speed. Belloc thrust his arm forward and a column of fire flew at Peter. Calmly, he raised his hand and a pale translucent blue field appeared, shielding him from the onslaught.

When Belloc pulled away, Peter was still standing; he paused, unsure how to next attack his now defensible opponent. With a slight kick, Peter pushed himself into the air and held himself there levitating several yards from the shell of the Mover.

Throughout his body, Peter could feel power coursing with Millie acting in concert with his movements. He closed his eyes and extended his hand up and behind him reaching towards the sun in the sky. Nothing else existed for him in that moment, just his complete focus and will.

A star of fire appeared beyond his outstretched hand and from it shot a swirling column of fire engulfing his arm. It was a greater and purer fire than that produced by Arthur or Belloc. In his chest, he could feel it building and he began mentally to harness it. He could feel every tool at his disposal being pushed to its extreme - fire beyond flame.

A wide loop of fire swirled to surround him like a whirling solar flare.

Peter opened his eyes.

In Belloc's eyes he could see amazement; no fear, just wonder. Peter raised his other hand in Belloc's direction. With a flash, he released the fire.

A great torrent of fire and light poured out and down into the Belloc Mover blasting clean through its armor hide. It stumbled and stopped for a brief moment and then its arms went limp at its sides as it began to collapse in on itself. Superheated metals sprayed molten fragments and internal machinery began to explode. The arching fire subsided as Peter released his hold on the forces and lowered himself back onto the giant's shoulder.

Belloc had been knocked far backward against a raised part of the shoulder plate his suit badly damaged and its flight capabilities were clearly non-functional. The blood coming from his mouth likely indicated he was seriously injured as well.

Suddenly, a massive object dropped into view - it was Peter's Mover extending its hand. Peter jumped onto it and turning back he could see Belloc still staring at him as he fell into the flaming mass of metal imploding on itself.

The surviving Mover coiled its arm back keeping Peter away from the destruction. It swung its other arm high into the air and brought it down across its opponent's now slack head.

The defeated giant began a slow twirl, collapsing, collapsing, collapsing. As it hit the ground massive explosions erupted and Peter's Mover took several steps back as a mighty fireball consumed the titan and Belloc.
