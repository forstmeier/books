At that moment, Lewis stood up from his place at the end of the table. All the room's occupants paused as he did so, commanding their attention. His hands bore metal gauntlets, larger than those worn by Peter and more imposing in their design, which had been out of sight below the table. He must have had them placed there in anticipation of this event before anyone had even arrived at Scholl.

Before anyone could blink he whipped his hands forward and a torrent of thick lightning bolts flew from his outstretched fingers. There was a thunderous blast as the cascading energy tore into More and Card's respective groups. Some were quick enough to duck behind chairs while body proximity shields embedded in their armor appeared to protect others. The blasts were so powerful soldiers were thrown back against the far wall.

With the opposition briefly ducking for cover, Lewis halted the blinding stream and before they could regain their balance, and without pausing threw his hands back behind him as if slapping something away from him. His hands generated a strong kinetic blast which smashed through the wall behind him and through the dust Peter could see the outside air.

"Go," said Lewis, his eyes focused on his targets across the table.

Arthur leaped towards the opening and shouted to Peter, "Follow me!"

Peter followed without even thinking. Bounding through the dust he leaped straight into thin air.
