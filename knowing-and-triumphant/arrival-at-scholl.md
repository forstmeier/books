Overhead Peter observed what appeared to be a moon floating in the upper atmosphere. Arthur spoke up from behind Peter, "That is _Lunella_, one of _Pangea's_ artificial moons. Those are the core level, basic components of the future moon to be set into orbit."

Even from their vantage point, Peter could make out some of the details of the structure. Large exposed pipes and beams were visible and the inner workings of the object could be seen.

"Smaller bodies like _Lunella_ will be used to coordinate bulk transportation and support special-mission establishments segregated from the broader _Pangea_ surface. _Lunella_ will not be much larger than two kilometers in diameter when complete - it will be small enough that you will be able to see its curvature when standing on the outer surface with artificial gravity holding individuals in place, of course. That is where the next stage of Proctor development will officially take place."

Peter gazed up at the miniature celestial body suspended in the atmosphere above him. He wasn't thinking about anything, just looking at it. Everything in his future seemed absolutely planned out and all he was made to do was to take each next step.

After flying for some time, the small flotilla arrived at an installation rising out of the grassland. It was a series of towers clustered together, similar in design to Hua, but more vertical and imposing. Surrounding it was a moderate-sized city that felt more like an afterthought to the castle-like building at its center. Arthur said the city's name was Scholl.

When they touched down on a landing platform off of one of the towers and disembarked, Lewis was escorted away from the rest of the group down a separate hallway. He was not restrained and moved of his own volition. At the last moment, before they were separated, he turned and looked at Peter.

No smile, no nod, nothing. But he stared into his eyes for a fleeting moment with pure focus. And then he was gone.
