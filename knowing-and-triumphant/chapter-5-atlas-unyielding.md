Peter woke to Arthur gently shaking him in his bunk. He could smell breakfast being prepared outside and after getting dressed he joined Lewis who was already eating. They ate in silence but Peter felt as though Lewis was more relaxed than he had been yesterday - as if some weight had been lifted off his shoulders.  

As the two finished, Arthur suddenly stepped out of the lodge and walked to the edge of the encampment staring off towards the horizon.  

"Sir, they are here."  

Peter stood, Lewis remained seated.  

Tiny shapes quickly materialized on the horizon before coalescing into skiffs filled with figures. They descended on their position quickly and Peter could see More and Belloc among their complements.  

On touchdown, armed security forces and robots jumped off and surrounded the campsite with drawn, but not brandished, weapons. Belloc leaped down with them and stood gazing intently on the fugitives; More remained standing on the ship.  

"Mr. Lewis" she called down, "good to see you. It was difficult getting in touch given the communications blackout we were experiencing until just this morning. Just such an inconvenient coincidence."  

"Thank you for your perseverance" responded Lewis. "Attributes like that are surely why you were selected for your role in ITAM. I remember voting to extend the you the offer quite well."  

More pursed her lips in frustration.  

"Would you be so kind as to allow us to escort you back? The facility is prepared for the next stage." her voice gaining a commanding edge - clearly this question only had one answer.  

"Absolutely," said Lewis, smiling back at More. He turned to Peter, "Alex is absolutely correct. It is time for the next stage of your development." Something in Lewis's voice seemed to indicate a sense of acceptance, or even comfort, with the whole situation.  

A ramp lowered from More's skiff and Lewis stepped on board followed by Peter and Arthur who had quickly gathered their things from the camp.  

"Are you alright, Damien?" asked More placing her hand on his shoulder.  

"Yes, I'm fine" he responded. "And my name is Peter now."  

She blinked in surprise, "Oh, okay, Peter" she said with a worried smile. "I'm glad you're back with us."  

Squeezing his shoulder reassuringly, she assumed a position beside him, adopting a protective stance. Nothing would be taking him away from her again.  

On the other hand, Lewis was the picture of calm. He reclined in the bow seating, as if he hadn't a care in the world, looking out over the speeding terrain below.  

Overhead Peter observed what appeared to be a moon floating in the upper atmosphere. Arthur spoke up from behind Peter, "That is _Lunella_, one of _Pangea's_ artificial moons." Even from their vantage point, Peter could make out some of the details of the structure. Large exposed pipes and beams were visible and the inner workings of the object could be seen.  

Peter gazed up at the miniature celestial body suspended in the atmosphere above him. He wasn't thinking about anything, just looking at it. Everything in his future seemed absolutely planned out and all he was made to do was to take each next step.  

After flying for some time, the small flotilla arrived at an installation rising out of the grassland. It was a series of towers clustered together, similar in design to Hua, but more vertical and imposing. Surrounding it was a moderate-sized city that felt more like an afterthought to the castle-like building at its center. Arthur said the city's name was Scholl.  

When they touched down on a landing platform off of one of the towers and disembarked, Lewis was escorted away from the rest of the group down a separate hallway. He was not restrained and moved of his own volition. At the last moment, before they were separated, he turned and looked at Peter.  

No smile, no nod, nothing. But he stared into his eyes for a fleeting moment with pure focus. And then he was gone.  

More brought Peter up to a dining room on the upper floors of the building. Open archways led to a balcony encircling the room and overlooking the landscape in a full three-sixty degree view.  

"We were worried about you," said More. "After your abduction, we immediately launched a search but our communications network down which hampered things. We didn't know what he would do with you."  

"I didn't know, either" responded Peter. "But he treated me well other than the kidnapping."  

"We're very thankful for that," said More, glancing at the silent Belloc. "What...did you two talk about?"

There was a brief pause.

"I think he wanted to guide me somehow. To give me direction. I'm not exactly sure but it seemed like he wanted me to understand responsibility and the responsibilities of my position. What it means to be Proctor. He wants freedom and self-direction," said Peter.  

Belloc gave a short, humorless laugh.  

"Yes, but this is costly."  

"Because sometimes" cut in More yet again "the free choices of some cause loses for many others. Not all people are good and their actions can lead to injustices. Why not prevent them before they occur?"  

"But why approach it like that?" asked Peter. "Why not hope for the best and plan for the worst?"  

"By taking action we become proactive, instead of reactive, to evils as they arise," answered More.  

Belloc added, "The very loss of control subverts the human presence in this world, a presence that is truly unique in the currently known universe. The capacity for self-awareness, understanding, and sentience is beyond all, other than our mechanical creations that we have willed into existence. That loss of control forfeits an endowed right of humanity."  

"Even giving up control over fellow humans?" asked Peter.  

"Yes" answered Belloc, "even then. Those who can provide guidance must do so. Asserting control and enforcing our will to bring order to chaos is part of our calling, both in terms of the natural world and for society as a whole - arguably the latter even more so. Freeing humanity from irrational behavior and moving us forward cohesively and beneficially is our greatest calling."  

There was a brief silence as Peter absorbed this information.  

"Peace is something that we can attain," said More. "Even today, hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people live in agony in our galaxy. Taking control could be a means to alleviate their suffering."  

"Has anyone done good if they're forced to do so? Isn't it an empty action?"  

"The point is that it gets the results needed" answered More, ignoring Peter's question. "Those with power should use it, otherwise they would be irresponsible and calloused as to the needs of others - they would bear the burden of their lack of action. Lifting the lowly is the responsibility of everyone, great and small, so why shouldn't those with power leverage their position to do so? Not doing so would be...wasteful."  

Peter again absorbed this statement silently.  

Turning to Belloc he asked, "And what happens to us when we do take up that power?"  

Belloc returned a small, hard smile.  

"Humanity will be improved," he said, his eyes distant. "We will grow and develop and become greater still than we ever were."  

So this was it, thought Peter to himself.  

These three individuals were seeking goals not dissimilar, but the varied perspectives and approaches to accomplish their ends couldn't be more different. More sought to establish peace, Belloc pursued perfection, Lewis desired independence. Each had a different emphasis but all were intending for the betterment of mankind.  

And each wanted to use him to leverage their worldview into being.  

"I want to help," said Peter in a quiet voice "but I'm still just making my way through all of this."  

More took a deep breath and with a face still etched with concern nodded, accepting Peter's decision. Belloc's face was immobile, as if set in stone, revealing nothing as he continued to cast his steely gaze over Peter.  

"Well," said More "there is one outstanding task left and it's why we are here at this facility. Let's walk and talk."  

They followed her back down into the lower levels of the tower through a series of elevators and hallways. Their surroundings were now more utilitarian than those of the dining room - white and blue lighting provided visibility but did little to brighten the spaces. Soon they came to the actual medical center.  

They walked past white-clad doctors, sterile attendant robots, airborn pseudo-organic jellyfish, robotic expectant mothers, swirling holograms, disembodied organs, and other oddities. All in the gentle, quiet hum of an active medical research facility.  

Eventually, they came to a room with a small, elevated dias in the middle. As they walked onto it, holograms lighted and began slowly rotating around them. They displayed a variety of schematics and what appeared to be an order of operations for some medical procedure. A human body was clearly outlined and it slowly rotated to face the group. A pit opened in Peter's stomach as he looked into his own face. The eyes were closed but he recognized himself from the reflection he saw back in Bellefonte.  

"You are the last stage of the first steps in our progress as humans" he heard More say through a dull ringing in his ears.  

Belloc leaned forward. "I believe that this is the truest of the true goals of ITAM and all other goals are subordinate to it. Humans are not merely recreating themselves or their environment; humans are not merely creating universal synergy. Humans are creating themselves into gods, achieving perfection."  

More chimed in, "Both a bodily perfection and a conscious enlightenment. Attaining pure reason through this would lead to better people, a better world."  

"We aren't gods" he heard himself say. "We can seek perfection without contradicting our place in the universe but we can never forget what we are. Human."  

Everyone in the group looked at him in silent surprise.  

It was as if the realization and speech hadn't been his own, yet he had seen it before himself so clearly. It was that feeling of learning a "truth" or an "absolute" and it feels so natural yet understanding it wasn't actually your own and existed in complete independence from the thinker.  

Peter shook his head as if to clear his thoughts and quickly changed the subject. "What does my elevation entail?"  

More and Belloc exchanged looks.  

"A medical operation, Peter," said More slowly. "It will be painful and carries great risk despite our exceptional technological and medical capabilities. The result of this process will be an activation of your dormant connection to the ITAM network and your full abilities as The Proctor."  

She was worriedly looking at him, again like a mother or older sister looking out for his best interests, despite him being a major player in forwarding her and Belloc's agendas.  

Peter lowered his head and quietly asked, "Could I be alone for a minute?"  

The two adults exchanged another look. More gently touched Peter's shoulder in reassurance before turning and leaving the room with Belloc. Arthur remained by the door silently attending.  

Peter looked about the room not really seeing anything and just too overwhelmed to think. The weight of the world pressed down on his shoulders.  

He felt like he wanted to cry. He was completely alone. Everyone was looking to him, expecting him to lead when he himself had no idea of his own ability. He was expected to shoulder a role he never asked for.  

As if sensing his mood, Arthur stepped forward comfortingly. Millie, who had remained silent but present up to this point, spoke up.  

"This is a great responsibility you have and it's one you never asked for. A daunting mantle to carry forward humanity."  

"It's difficult but it doesn't mean its impossible" she continued in a soft voice. "Be strong. This is the start of your greatest test: the test of life. You heard and learned of the intent of the others and yes, everything beyond this point is ultimately your decision, but there will be people there with you, to help you. There will be many enormous decisions waiting for you, every day of your life, but we will be there to help you."  

Arthur spoke up, "I may not always appear to be a your adjunct, but I have been charged with protecting and supporting your person and I feel that even beyond this order, I wish to do good in your service. We will be here for you, Proctor Hopeful."  

Peter still felt wretchedly nervous. He was at the center of a tug-of-war between opposing forces - he was the knot they needed to pull to their side in order to win. Their motives were obvious now.  

He thought over the factions again, Lewis, More, and Belloc. How would he know how to balance which was right or even if any of them were right at all?  

"I'll always be with you" whispered Millie in his ear.  

Just then, Peter was filled a great resolve. This was a challenge and he would rise to it. Even if he was unready, he would seek to prove himself.  

He would find the truth. The truth of himself, the truth of the world.  

Arthur turned to leave.  

"I'll do it," said Peter quietly.  

The robot stopped and turned back to look at him.  

"I will do it," said Peter again, this time with strength in his voice.  

He turned and looked resolutely into Arthur and Millie's faces. Arthur nodded, seemingly happy and Peter could almost feel a smile come across his emotionless faceplate.  

"Excellent, sir. I shall inform Ms. More and Dr. Belloc."  

Millie knelt down on the invisible ground she stood upon and placed her hand in Peter's direction. She smiled at him with genuine kindness. Whatever happened, he knew she truly would be with him.  

After leaving the room and confirming his decision, with the others Peter was stripped and wrapped in a medical tunic and brought to a launch bay where he was seen off by Belloc and More. He boarded a ship which quickly brought him and a retinue of medical officers, robots, and Arthur, who now held Millie's projector, to _Lunella_. Hours of pre-operation checks followed before he was finally deposited in an empty hallway, with a closed door to his back separating him even from Arthur and Millie. A long, wide window to his left overlooked the expanse of _Pangea_'s landscape at dusk from low-orbit. He began to slowly walk down the hallway, his bare feet making small padding noises as he went.  

One step and then another.  

At the far end was a door which opened automatically as he approached. Inside was a completely dark room except for a sole spotlight shining down on an operating table. Several robotic arms were attached to it supporting various medical devices and syringes.  

Peter stepped forward and lay down on it. He reached over and activated the system through the holographic readout beside him.  

Restraints moved into place to keep his legs and arms immobile throughout the procedure. The robotic arms whirred to life and began slowly moving into position.  

There was no going back now.  

Without warning, he felt simultaneous, sharp pinches where each of the devices touched his skin. Pain flooded through his body as the injections were triggered.  

It was as if his skeleton had turned to molten steel and every one of his nerves was on fire.  

A roaring noise filled his ears.  

He screamed but couldn't hear it.  

His body shook violently but he couldn't feel it.  

And then everything went black.
