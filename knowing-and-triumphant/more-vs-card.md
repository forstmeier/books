But Lewis pressed on ignoring Card's comments.

"Before you arrived, Alexandra here was laying out her plans to install the Proctor on board battleship _Thulcandra_ - it's an interesting suggestion, what do you think?"

An aghast look flew over Card's face. The installation point must have been a previously established and well-known part of the plan for the Proctor. It was something embedded into the fundamental fabric of the project to the point that any deviation from the long-standing orders solicited such strong emotions from Card.

He turned on More in a fluster.

"I demand an explanation" he blustered out.

"It was necessary given the situation so as to isolate the Proctor from the contagion that might otherwise adversely impact the mission." More found the words quickly and delivered them smoothly. She was a practiced communicator.

"That situation is now under control and we will move forward under the prearranged settings," responded Card.

"The level of manipulation is still unclear" pressed More. "Something as yet unknown could be triggered as Lewis himself stopped short from actually boarding the Mover on their escape."

Card waved a hand in dismissal - he was a man governed purely by procedure.

"Lewis's prior actions are of no concern. We are to move forward with the primary orders with respect to the Proctor program."

More stepped forward resolutely.

"I must insist, Mr. Card."

Her tone was now commanding and a quiet fell on the room. Card turned fully to face her.

"How DARE you countermand the binding orders of ITAM!" shouted Card, his voice choked in fury. "Who are you to change the course of history set before us?!"

"I dare because it is our only course of action. We cannot leave to chance the danger of this man's schemings, blatant manipulation, and destructive actions. He destroyed The Machine, he stole the Proctor hopeful."

More braced herself.

"Orders have been issued by the Executive Leadership initiating the contingency plan that removes the Oversight Committee due to an unfitness for command."

The two individuals faced off.

Card fuming, ready to burst. More coiled, prepared to spring.

The tension in the room was palpable. A man bound by his mission, a woman driven by purpose.
