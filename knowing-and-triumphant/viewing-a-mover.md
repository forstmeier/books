Still manning the controls, Arthur pivoted the ship and began to run them parallel to the edge of the completed landscape. The dust kicked up by the line of workers along the in-progress segment could still be seen far off in the distance.

A new object began to come into view ahead and to the left. Millie reappeared next to Peter on the couch.

"That's one of the great Movers," she said in a hushed tone. "They're giant robots used in the production of large-scale construction projects. Most are currently being used to finish the frame of _Pangea_ in what remains of the unconstructed zones. The largest loads and adjustments, like pseudo-tectonic placements, are performed by the Movers."

The massive humanoid robot lumbered along the shell planet's skeleton. It stood several times taller than the altitude they were currently flying at and had a large body and thick, trunk-like arms and legs. A disproportionately small head hunched into the machine's shoulders which were made up of large pauldron plates.

"One of these is yours," said Millie.

"What do you mean?" asked Peter, surprised.

"She means that one of these is to be your base of operations," interjected Lewis. "Your connection to the ITAM network was placed in one, not this one though," he said gesturing towards the lumbering giant.

"It's actually quite a striking look, your Mover" added Millie. "Painted all white with blue markings and a giant Seal of the Proctor across its shoulder."

"Once our preparations are complete, we will go to the Proctor's Mover which is dubbed the _Arbiter_," said Lewis. "It will bear you while you complete _Pangea_. Use it to ensure that the world is respected as well as the people in it."

Lewis returned to his seat and picking his tablet back up he said to Arthur, "We should go to our lodging for the night."

"As you wish, sir," responded Arthur cheerfully.

He had already begun to veer them back towards the terraformed zone and now, as they approached the landscape, it was clear that it had gotten quite late in the afternoon. They passed back into the desert territory in an area where there were no workers making it an oddly stark transition between the two zones. Going from bare metal to lifelike desert.
