Sailing over the tall grass in the sunset gave him space to think. Stars began to appear in the brown sunset sky as the faintest beginnings of the eventual starfield that would unfold. It was all so crystal clear and untainted. Before long he came across a hydraulics hub protruding from the ground standing a few feet higher than the top of the grass and with enough room to lay down on.

Millie appeared next to him as he sat down.

"Busy day, huh?"

Peter grunted in agreement.

"Yes, it was. What do you think of it all?"

Millie blew threw her cheeks. "It's a ridiculous game Lewis ran us through. I can't quite figure out what his intent is. He is following the core ITAM directives, that much is clear, but it also appears that he is in active conflict with the company's executives. Someone on the other end must have been able to reestablish the communications network because I was finally able to access it."

"Just before you arrived on _Pangea_, Lewis was ordered off of his current assignment by a man named Card who is the Chairman of the Oversight Committee. He even went so far as to demand Lewis's arrest."

"Well, in that last bit he said on our trip, he seems to honestly believe in freedom and self-direction," said Peter. "He genuinely seems to be trying to help me find my way regardless of what the other leaders say."

"Yes," said Millie. "And right now you could very easily pilot this skimmer off into the horizon and make our way back to the city. And he has given you that opportunity. So the period of detainment appears to be over."

Peter thought for a moment.

"I'll stay."

Millie nodded.

"Okay. Then I'm staying with you. No matter what happens."

The two of them sat in silence for another hour or so before boarding the skimmer and returning back to the lodge. Lewis was already asleep, or at least appeared to be, in one of the wall bunk alcoves when they arrived. Arthur was standing in resting mode off in a corner but re-activated as they entered.

He stepped forward and helped Peter prepare for bed. "I hope you can understand my position, sir, and accept my apology for the actions I was under orders to execute today."

"I do, Arthur, and thank you."

Although his face was expressionless, Peter almost sensed a relieved and happy smile on the robot's metal face.

"Good night, sir."

"Good night, Arthur."

Peter was still very unsure of Lewis but he was no longer outright nervous. While his true motives were unclear, it was apparent he was in no immediate danger. And in that state of mind, Peter drifted off into sleep.
