Suddenly Millie projected herself out and in front of Peter, increasing her projection size to one-half scale.

"Alright, what is this all about?" she challenged. "And don't go waving your hand about - I took that little trick away so you might as well answer, you ass."

Peter froze mid-chew at her point-blank question and waited for Lewis to answer. Millie stood there floating, hands akimbo glaring across at the chairman.

Lewis continued passively chewing his meal, ignoring the angry AI.

"Oh, real mature," she quipped. "You want to teach him about himself and expect that showing him the actions of a petulant child will really help him."

"I'm not teaching him anything right now so I don't need to speak. You can interpret that as you will."

"I damn well will interpret it that way" she retorted. "You seriously want us to believe what you say after holding us at gunpoint-"

"I never held either of you at gunpoint," he interjected.

"That's just because Peter never gave you a reason. And because shooting a hologram is the only dumber thing you could do at that moment."

"Do you honestly think that I need a gun to forward this agenda?" he said, looking up from his food giving Millie a look of pure steel.

Millie's face twisted into a frown of disapproval but she fell silent.

Lewis went back to his food and Millie shrunk down to her previous size and gave Peter a little helpless shrug.
