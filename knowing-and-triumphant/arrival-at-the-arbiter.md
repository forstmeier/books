Following behind in a resolute line, the pursuers were gradually making up the distance between them and would periodically fire on them when they had the chance. Millie continued to provide updates while helping to optimize his flight systems and speed.

"INCOMING ROCKET!" she shouted. An RPG fired by one of their pursuers whisked past them as they twisted out of the way. The projectile exploded a short distance in front of them and they swerved to avoid the blast.

Arthur swung out in a wide arc close to the ground while Peter shot straight upwards. Three robots broke off to pursue Arthur while the remaining two followed Peter higher.

"Cut all thruster power on the count of three," said Millie in his ear, her voice full of energy.

Peter could feel the wind pressing against him as they rose faster and faster.

"One..."

Insanity.

"Two..."

Definitely don't look down.

"Three!"

The propulsors halted and Peter rapidly lost his upward momentum. He tilted backward in a somersault; now he was looking straight down - from a dizzyingly high point. He barely had time to register the ridiculous situation as his pursuers were ascending on his position too quickly.

They attempted to slow their climb but in doing so they brought themselves off balance.

"GAUNTLETS, NOW!" screamed Millie.

Peter raised his hand towards the first of the robots - he felt a trigger pull in his mind. A small rocket tore from his wrist and blew apart the attacker's face just feet away.

The other spun off above and behind him but was still close by. It caught itself quickly and wheeled around as if it were skating on an invisible wall with its propulsors.

Its uplifted face angled down towards Peter keeping him in complete focus, looking directly at him, with nothing but its grim, robotic intent behind its photoreceptors.

"Alright, you got this," said Millie in his ear.

Blades appeared out of the robot's gauntlets. They looked holographic but more "solid", like a physical light projected and held in place. It was coming for an in-person kill.

The robot sprang towards him closing the gap between them in a split second. At the last moment, a fraction of a second, Peter materialized a blade of his own from his wrist. With a tiny jet blast, he twisted to the side and swinging his blade out in a great loop he slashed across his opponent's arm. The limb fell off into space as the now one-armed robot spun to regain its position as it dropped past Peter.

Without warning, its body burst into pieces and through the fireball flew Arthur up and past the suspended Proctor.

"We must keep moving," said Arthur in haste. "Reinforcements are on their way."

From their vantage point, they could see several ships approaching them from far off in the distance.

"This way," said Arthur and again they were speeding off across the landscape.

Soon a shape appeared ahead of them on the horizon. Gradually it formed into a giant walking bipedal outline. The Arbiter. Its blue and white paint scheme stood out against the green and brown landscape. As it trudged towards them, Peter could finally see just how truly massive it was.

But when they got closer, another shape was visible not too far off. A second Mover. This one did not bear the markings of the Proctor. And it was making a bee-line for the _Arbiter_.

It was there for him.

Peter was sick to his stomach. There would be a literal titanic fight between the two giants.

He followed Arthur to the chest of the behemoth. Arthur pulled back and motioned Peter forward towards a port on the chest. As he floated closer he opened the door without thinking, ducking in through the hatch into a small airlock big enough to stand in. His propulsors cut as he stepped onto the floor as naturally as if he were descending stairs.

None of this registered; his mind was a singular focus.

His induction as the Proctor would be a baptism of blood. His ascension would be seen only in his victory. There was no more running.

He was going to have to fight.
