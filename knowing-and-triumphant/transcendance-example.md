They followed her back down into the lower levels of the tower through a series of elevators and hallways. Their surroundings were now more utilitarian than those of the dining room - white and blue lighting provided visibility but did little to brighten the spaces. Soon they came to the actual medical center.

Even though it was brighter, with white and gray paneling and glass walls looking into observation rooms, it still had a darker, subdued feeling to it. Doctors, scientists, and attendants were moving about sedately on various projects.

Belloc took the lead of the group with Peter and Arthur following just behind with More taking up the rear. He got the sense that she was continuing to watch over him protectively in an almost motherly way. Worried and concerned. Belloc pushed forward unflinchingly.

"ITAM has also been seeking to expand human existence directly, building upon biological building blocks established by nature."

They passed through an open area of the facility in the middle of which was a large, jellyfish-like object. It gently floated through the room with the top of its head floating a few feet above Belloc. Long, thin tentacles serenely cascaded down from its body as it moved about.

While it looked alive, it did not appear to be fully biological. It seemed to be more like the Artisans they had observed at the construction site - pseudo-organic.

"That push towards improvement has always been a fundamental part of our evolution. We humans are not static achievements and are continually moving forward both through natural evolution and deliberate projects."

He pointed towards the jellyfish suspended in the air.

"That is Ms. Liu, one of our longest-serving members of ITAM. Years ago her body began to deteriorate with an inoperable disease and so we began the task of transferring her consciousness into this artificial chamber."

Liu floated close to Peter and a tentacle reached up probing the air between them. Belloc gave a slight bow towards the floating body.

"Ms. Liu represents an incredible step towards the transcendence of the human mind and spirit. Achieving this sort of enlightenment following the removal of the physical form is something mystics have sought for eons. In her current form, Liu continues to provide valued input through the philosophy of science. She also opted for her vessel to have no vocal capabilities and communicates solely through Morse code."

"That sort of disembodiment is not our primary goal," said More as they continued onward. "But it is part of our long-term experiment roadmap as a landless nation. Ultimately, we are seeking something more permanent, more "natural" - we want to improve humanity, both societally and biologically, not replace it entirely. We are not just integrating with the environment but also synthesizing with technology."

They passed another circular station in the middle of which there stood a figure. Her legs formed roots to the floor while tubes rose from her back and skull into the ceiling. Pipes formed her arms alongside her body and her stomach was swollen in what appeared to be pregnancy.

A gentle countenance was permanently fixed to her facemask as doctors moved about monitoring equipment. In her transparent womb, Peter could see a biomechanical baby revolving. He watched as it slowly turned towards him and suddenly it looked up, straight into his eyes. Radiantly blue and translucent human-like eyes stared into his.

"We are seeking out ways to produce the healthiest organism to hold humanity's existence but those," said Belloc gesturing at the mother and child "are just robots, not humans. While they are helping us to understand synthesis better, but we will need a different approach to create _homo syntheticus_."

"And that brings us to you, Peter."
