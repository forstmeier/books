Just then, Peter was filled a great resolve. This was a challenge and he would rise to it. Even if he was unready, he would seek to prove himself.

He would find the truth. The truth of himself, the truth of the world.

Arthur turned to leave.

"I will do it," said Peter quietly.

The robot stopped and turned back to look at him.

"I will do it," said Peter again, this time with strength in his voice.

He turned and looked resolutely into Arthur and Millie's faces. Arthur nodded, seemingly happy and Peter could almost feel a smile come across his emotionless faceplate.

"Excellent, sir. I shall inform Ms. More and Dr. Belloc."

"Thank you, Arthur."

Millie knelt down on the invisible ground she stood upon and placed her hand in Peter's direction. She smiled at him with genuine kindness. Whatever happened, he knew she truly would be with him.

After leaving the room and confirming his decision, with the others Peter was stripped and wrapped in a medical tunic and brought to a launch bay where he was seen off by Belloc and More. He boarded a ship which quickly brought him and a retinue of medical officers, robots, and Arthur, who now held Millie's projector, to _Lunella_.

What followed were many hours of pre-operation checks with various departments. Disinfecting, cleaning, blood samples, and more. Another sterile room, robots only this time. Mobile IVs were attached and several monitoring devices as well.

Finally, he was deposited in an empty hallway, with a closed door to his back separating him even from Arthur and Millie. A long, wide window to his left overlooked the expanse of _Pangea_'s landscape at dusk from low-orbit. He began to slowly walk down the hallway, his bare feet making small padding noises as he went.

One step and then another.

At the far end was a door which opened automatically as he approached. Inside was a completely dark room except for a sole spotlight shining down on an operating table. Several robotic arms were attached to it supporting various medical devices and syringes.

Peter stepped forward and lay down on it. He reached over and activated the system through the holographic readout beside him.

Restraints moved into place to keep his legs and arms immobile throughout the procedure. The robotic arms whirred to life and began slowly moving into position.

There was no going back now.

Without warning, he felt simultaneous, sharp pinches where each of the devices touched his skin. Pain flooded through his body as the injections were triggered.

It was as if his skeleton had turned to molten steel and every one of his nerves was on fire.

A roaring noise filled his ears.

He screamed but couldn't hear it.

His body shook violently but he couldn't feel it.

And then everything went black.
