Noticing Damien's stare, the hologram turned to regard him. Her eyes pierced into him, as if she could see into his being - it created an uneasy feeling of bareness before her.

"Hello, Damien," she said. "My name is Millicent but you can call me Millie."

"Hello" he responded, surprised that she already knew his name.

Millie tilted her head to the side inquisitively.

"Are you nervous?"

"No" shot back Damien defensively; she had caught him off guard. This being elicited a queasiness in Damiano when she looked at him, at his core. She brought to the surface ignored, or stifled, awareness of the growing responsibility thrust upon him.

Millie pressed on placing a hand on her hip, "Do _I_ make you nervous?"

"No" responded Damien more quietly than before.

"Well, that's okay then - as long as it isn't _me_."

Lewis spoke up, "Millicent's responsibilities and operational scope are wide and officially non-defined. She works as she sees fit to help forward whatever project that we assign her to." Turning to Damiano, he said, "That assignment is now you."

"Me?" asked Damien, surprised yet again.

"You don't have a particularly large vocabulary, do you?" asked Millie in a pointed joke.

Damiano flushed with embarrassment.

"Well it's true!" she said throwing her hands up as More shot her a look. "He has quite literally only said three words, only two of which were unique, in as many sentences since I've seen him."

"Maybe you could learn a thing from him and keep quiet" snapped More.

"Oh, but I do love the sound of my own voice."

"For a piece of software you-"

"Millicent will be coming with us," interjected Lewis firmly and the squabbling pair fell abruptly silent. Lewis picked up a small device from the table gesturing towards the hologram with it.

Millicent nodded in compliance and her hologram flickered off as a blue light lit up on the circular device in Lewis's hand. He walked to Damiano and clipped it onto the shoulder of his suite and a foot-tall hologram of Millie materialized over his shoulder.

"Transfer complete" she reported to Lewis.

"Good. Let's continue."

Damiano's face burned as Millie's image flicked away.

"Don't worry, I don't bite. I literally can't bite" she whispered from the device, just loud enough for him to hear. "This will be fun; call me Millie."

This was not going to be fun.
