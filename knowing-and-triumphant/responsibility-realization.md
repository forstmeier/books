Damien paused in thought for a moment before again posing a question. "Do you trust our creators? After everything that they've done and forced you to do?"

"It is irrelevant whether or not I trust my creators, only that I fulfill the mission that requires decisive judgments that change the course of history for the better. The weight of the mantle is a great but necessary burden."

And then the realization came. "I'm your successor" whispered Damien.

The machine turned to look at him again. Damien swallowed nervously but continued.

"But if ITAM has built such an effective bearer of its mission why would they bring in me? I can err just like any human - I could ruin everything."

"You are the next stage in the design of ITAM & Co." said the machine. "And you are correct; you are far more dangerous than I. I cannot make foreseen mistakes as my choices are based on probabilities, not judgment. I am not vulnerable to emotions or chemical interactions. But you are the superior construct."

"You posses the human quality of creativity. I can build, you can create." The machine shifted and adjusted itself slightly as if it were getting into a more comfortable position. "I am a placeholder. It is your assignment to bring about the next stage of evolution for ITAM & Co. and the world. At this point in time, you are the single most important living human. It is a great burden should you stoop to pick it up. My role will continue on as an advisor."
