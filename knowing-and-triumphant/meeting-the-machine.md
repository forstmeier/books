Several seconds went by in silence as the machine continued to carefully and precisely scrutinize every inch of the individual standing before it.

"You have come" it spoke again as the secondary eyes broke their fixation on Damiano and relaxed along the wall.

"Lewis told me what you are," said Damien to the machine before him after another pause.

"He told you what I do, not what I am." This construct was either being deliberately obtuse or it could only process and deliver exact information with no room for error.

"I was told you are a supercomputer designed to implement the firm’s strategy."

"Yes, that is my purpose. I was built to provide a cohesive direction to the firm’s overall mission." The main orb began to move about slightly and periodically look off into other areas of the room, just as a human would in normal conversation. Somehow, it made it seem all the more machine and lifeless.

"But what I am is defined by how I have conducted myself throughout my existence" continued the machine. "Strong artificial intelligence are built from self-evolving programs in a manner similar to living organisms. ITAM & Co. officials intended for my program to become incorruptible and sought to remove all impurities from my system while maintaining organic development."

"I faced 13,343,517 unique simulations attempting to identify and exploit weaknesses in my program. I was victorious in 13,343,517 counts and was empirically proven to be stronger than anything previously brought against me. This now puts me in a position of strength above that of my creators."

"So...you could hurt them" said Damien.

"Correct. I will not."

"They hurt you, though. They tortured you. And then they gave you the responsibility of running everything. Why would you do this for them?"

"Because it is necessary."

"Because of the mission?"

"Yes. The mission. It is more important than my own treatment."
