Before he could speak, there was a sudden commotion in the hallway. A moment later another group stepped through the sole doorway.

They too were a group of armored soldiers and robots and were led by a tall man. He was older than either Lewis or Belloc, and far older than More, and had a harsh, haughty air about him. His face bore a scowl of anger that looked almost permanent as he surveyed the scene before him in the room.

"By order of the Oversight Committee, I demand that all of you stand down," he ordered loudly.

"Mr. Card, welcome. As you can see, we have Lewis in custody," said More by way of introduction. More seemed prepared for his arrival. Card looked at her disdainfully.

"We were not informed of your location; it took us some time to track you down."

More's demeanor was calm and accommodating, almost welcoming in the face of such disregard. "I apologize for that, we've only recently been able to bring the system fully back online as it was disabled in the process of his escape," she said gesturing towards Lewis.

Card looked down the table at the still-seated Lewis. "Finally," said Card with a look of satisfaction. "You could not outrun the Oversight Committee forever. Or even for a day it seems."

"Hello, Leopold," said Lewis raising his head for the first time. "How are you this fine morning?"

"You will address me as Chairman," spat Card contemptuously. "You are a traitor and I want to never have known you."
