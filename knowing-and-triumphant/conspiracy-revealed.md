This whole while, Lewis had been sitting and observing the confrontation, letting the issue fester rapidly between the two parties. He interjected into the pregnant interlude.

"Alexandra is correct in several of her accusations, but I should provide some context around my attack on Simon and the overall situation."

The holographic projector in the middle of the table lit up and a shape projected itself into the air near Lewis's chair.

It was Simon.

Only his main photoreceptor and a portion of his wall apparatus could be seen but there was no mistaking him. He sat silently observing the room as his wall mount adjusted in perpetual, tiny motions. Lewis must have only damaged him, rather than destroy him completely. And now here he appeared apparently on Lewis's orders.

Stunned looks came over the faces of both More and Card.

"An attempt to undermine the Proctor's authority was inevitable," continued Lewis. "So much power concentrated into a single area would be irresistible to doers of good and evil alike and, as is my responsibility, I took measures to prevent it from coming to fruition. I didn't know, and didn't need to know, who the perpetrators would be; all that I needed to ensure was their treason reached to the highest levels of the ITAM hierarchy in order to instantly give it credence in the eyes of the likes of the Oversight Committee."

"So I made myself the target." The room remained silent as Lewis paused for a moment, letting the information sink in.

"Drawing out the conspiracy would be easier if they were granted easier access to the resources and write the contingencies they hoped to establish so I used my leverage as Chairman to do so. The specifics of the plan were all well hidden, I give you full credit for that, and only figured out who the core conspirators were in the past few days. I did however add in the requirements for an adjunct to be assigned to the Proctor Hopeful to keep tabs on location and initial conspirator movements" he said, nodding in Arthur's direction. He really had been a guardian and protector this whole time.

"Once it was clear that a Proctor had been finally created, I released the rumor that the Chairman was seeking to overthrow the operation."

If the room could have gotten any more silent, it would have.

"There would be enough substantiating evidence, coupled with my rank, to immediately merit Oversight intervention as well as a military presence in the situation. The conspirators were likely to take this as a fortunate twist since it would further distract from their own operations, even if just briefly. In that moment, they could attempt to sway the Proctor Hopeful into joining their cause voluntarily."

"And as for the Machine, incapacitating him was necessary for his protection. Removing the Machine would be a crucial part of their operation as it would be unlikely that it would comply with their plan of installing the Proctor under their control. But they would require a high-level authority to order his decommissioning. Disabling it and making it appear completely inoperable would effectively remove the Machine from consideration. And as it was assumed inoperable, it would not be considered as a possible source for the communication breakdown or any other adverse conditions you faced in locating us."
