Arthur led him down a comfortably lit hallway to a dining room with large paneled windows overlooking a cityscape shrouded in a dark and drumming storm. Near the window stood Dr. Belloc, watching as they entered. Seated at the far end of a long dining table in the center of the room was a woman.  

"Hello, Damien," she said with a smile as she stood up and crossed the room offering her hand which Damien awkwardly shook. It was warm to the touch and her grip was strong but somehow encouraging. His first true human contact.  

"I'm Alexandra More, the Chief Executive Officer here at ITAM & Co. How do you feel?"  

"I feel good, ma'am" he responded.  

"Oh, great, I'm glad to hear that. I've been very excited at the chance to meet you. Please, have a seat. And you can call me Alex," she beamed at him as he sat down at the table.    

"And if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask." She resumed her seat and paused for a moment before speaking. Dr. Belloc observed silently from his position by the window.  

"This all must be so new to you" she started with another smile. "Everything all at once, with no time to process it...I can't even imagine... We really are truly glad that you are with us now, Damien."  

Again she paused carefully searching for the words to use.  

"As it happens, this is...unprecedented territory for us as well" nodding toward Dr. Belloc, "so we will proceed discreetly. You...don't have any idea of what you are, do you?" she asked.  

"N-no, I don't. Well, I'm something that was made, but I don't really know..."  

"That's okay," said More, again smiling sweetly at him across the table as his words trailed off, "I wouldn't expect you to, I was just curious myself."  

"I do, somehow, know what things are around me" he volunteered, a little more confident with More's welcoming attitude. "Like, I know that this is a table and that's rain outside."  

"That's very good, Damien. It shows that we were successful in the first stage of your development. You have a core set of imprinted knowledge so that you could interact with the world immediately upon activation. You are...the singular result of the work of hundreds of individuals."  

"I'm a...project?" he asked, remembering Arthur's earlier comment.  

"You're a person" came the firm response from More. "A person, a human. Like me and Dr. Belloc," gesturing towards the figure standing by the window. "You're one of us." A heavily muffled boom of thunder punctuated her statement.
