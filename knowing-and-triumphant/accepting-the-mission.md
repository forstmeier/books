He felt a flush of nervousness and excitement in his chest at the invitation. While he did not fully, truly understand this company's mission or his place in it, he wanted to learn more about it and this world he had been brought into. He wanted to help them.  

"Yes," he replied.  

"Excellent!" More responded, beaming warmly at him. Both onlookers visibly relaxed. "Well, now that we have that out of the way, we have a big day tomorrow so you better go get some sleep. Have your robot bring you a snack before bed, I'm sure you're hungry."  

As Damiano stood to leave, More said, "We can answer all of your questions tomorrow at length. For now, I just want you to know that we're very happy that you're here with us, Damien."    

More looked towards Dr. Belloc who nodded in agreement.  

"Thank you," said Damien and followed Arthur down the hallway to a small but comfortable bedroom.  

After wolfing down the snack of banana bread Arthur brought him and completing his toiletries, Damiano crawled into bed. It was a lovely feeling, curling between the mattress and the blankets. Despite the myriad of questions swirling about in his mind, it did not take long for his eyes to close for the first sleep of his life.
