These three individuals were seeking goals not dissimilar, but the varied perspectives and approaches to accomplish their ends couldn't be more different. More sought to establish peace, Belloc pursued perfection, Lewis desired independence. Each had a different emphasis but all were intending for the betterment of mankind.

He just wanted to crawl back into that bed in the office tower and feel completely engulfed by that warm, cozy feeling of the blankets swaddling him.
