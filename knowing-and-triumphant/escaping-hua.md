Just then, an explosion tore apart the hallway before them and through the smoke stepped More. Peter's heart leaped when he saw her.

In a brief beat, she and Lewis made eye contact. Swiftly grabbing Peter's arm he turned to go down yet another side hallway.

"STOP!" screamed More as she lurched forward.

Just as calmly as he had lashed out at Simon, Lewis raised his pistol and began firing down the corridor at More. She and the troops following her through the gaping hole where a door used to be dove for cover. The four robots of Lewis's escort stepped forward and took up defensive positions along the walls firing on More's group pinning them down. Flashing colors and bits of debris flew everywhere as the firefight erupted. Lasers flashed between the dueling factions. A cacophony of loud bangs and zaps filled the air as Peter was escorted roughly from the battle.

Lewis rushed Peter through the hallway, closing and sealing each door they passed through. Finally, they reached the end and found themselves on a small, concealed landing dock. Parked in the middle was an open-aired skiff floating gently above the ground with Arthur waiting patiently behind the controls for them to arrive.

Peter hoped that More was unhurt from the skirmish.

"Take off."

"Yes sir, at once," replied the robot and the ship rose swiftly into the air.

Peter looked back and as he did small figures burst out of Simon's building and he could just barely make out Belloc's rigid figure staring helplessly as the skiff disappeared into the distance. Buildings and towers whisked by as they skimmed low over the cityscape which quickly gave way to wide open grassland as they passed over the outskirts. Arthur gunned the engines into high gear and they shot out across the landscape.
