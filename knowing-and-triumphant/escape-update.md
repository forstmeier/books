Lewis sat in silence for a few moments thinking of what to say. When he finally spoke, his tone had become more "human" and less standoffish. It was as if he had removed some mask or persona and was speaking as himself for the first time. His voice was steady and warm. Still, every word had meaning and was delivered with precisely chosen intent as a man of conviction and vision.

"I want to help you," he said earnestly. "A very great burden has been placed on you and right now you couldn't possibly understand its implications. I'm here to help you understand your place in this world."

"If you're here to help, why are you treating us like prisoners?"

"I need you to follow me."

They fell silent for a while as the ship continued zipping across the terrain. Below them the grass-covered landscape rippled in the wind. A river cut through the windswept scene with the crystalline water falling through a rocky riverbed. In the distance, towering hills rose from the ground. It all felt ancient and storied despite it having been man-made not too long ago.

Millie bent close to his ear and spoke softly. Peter had a passing thought that it was odd for her to do that, being a hologram and her vocal projection actually coming from the emitter pinned to his shoulder. She really had incredibly human-like mannerisms.

"I haven't been able to break through the blackout," she reported. "It seems as though Lewis has taken down the entire communication system at the hardware level. Because of that, I won't likely be able to get any sort of message out via direct means. I'll explore some of the unit-to-unit latent communication networks and see if that's a viable option."

She continued wearily.

"Unfortunately there does appear to be a highly powerful AI involved in that network for some reason and it's actively countering my attempts to access the system. There are only a handful of ITAM constructs capable of this level of defense as I'm quite literally hitting it with every resource I've got. It feels like I'm playing a chess match but instead of playing it on a board it's on a Rubix cube and the Rubix cube is fighting back."

"Can I help?"

She sighed.

"Not yet, you can't," she responded almost wishfully.
