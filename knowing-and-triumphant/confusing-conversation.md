Peter stood and moved towards the bow over which he could see off in the distance but approaching rapidly, a small mechanical structure rising from the landscape. A sole robot was visible on it going about his work maintaining the equipment.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

Peter whipped around to find Lewis had come up behind him silently. He turned back to the landscape, attempting to ignore Lewis. The craft began to slow and glide higher up and over the structure. It must be some sort of backup power plant or energy junction based on the pipes spreading off of it and into the ground.

Looking up as they approached, the short, humanoid robot raised a hand to wave as they flew by overhead. Peter waved back.

"What do you want with me?" asked Peter turning to confront his captor.

"I want you to be where you're meant to be."

"I don't know what that means; that means nothing."

"I want what's best for you."

"No, you don't," shot back Peter. "You threatened me, you hurt Simon, and you attacked my friends!"

There was a brief pause.

"Is that what you think happened back there?" asked Lewis, his voice was low and calm.

"Back there the people don't threaten me!" he shouted.

Lewis offered no response and they continued on over the grassy expanse in silence, staring at each other.

"I want to be back with my friends. You aren't my friend."

"I don't need you to be with your friends," responded Lewis. "I just need you to be where you need to be."

"But what does that mean?!" shouted Peter as Lewis walked towards the bow of the ship to take a seat on the circular couch there.

"One thing we are here to do is to discuss your future," he said. "Millicent should be here as well." At that, Millie rematerialized over Peter's shoulder and despite the disappointed look on her face, she gave Peter an encouraging nod. He hoped that she was still at work behind the scenes attempting to get the word out about their location.
