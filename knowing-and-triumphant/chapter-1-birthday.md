Damien sat in the locker room by himself quietly taking in his surroundings. Just several hours earlier he had awoken in a dim gray-blue laboratory suspended in a large, clear, liquid-filled container. A storm outside faintly illuminated the scene.  

Several individuals were in the laboratory and one had introduced himself as Dr. Belloc, the lead physician and partner on his case, and assured him that he was safe. He remembered the doctor's steely, focused gaze as he informed Damien of his name and that his project designation was SH-335C - a meaningless and confusing piece of information to the young boy.  

After being released from the container, and after a battery of tests and examinations, he was led to the locker room he presently found himself in. Recessed lights provided a nicely cozy feeling. Several shelves were stacked high with crisp, white towels and robes.  

His first memories.  

"Hello, there" came a chipper, mechanical voice.  

A tall, thin, humanoid robot stepped into the room carrying a set of clothes in Damien's size.  

"H-Hello" answered Damien.    

"My name is Arthur, designation T19-73, assigned as your personal attendant" the robot continued cheerfully "I'll be available to assist you in any way that you need. Here's a change of clothes."  

Damien proceeded to dress himself as the robot went about collecting the discarded medical gown and slippers. It was an odd sensation, putting on real clothes for the first time. They were somewhat utilitarian in design and had small mechanical nodes and plates affixed to them as if they were the base layer to some larger pieces of equipment the wearer could apply.  

"Your arrival has been highly anticipated," chatted the robot amiably. "A great deal of excitement has grown around you in recent weeks. I suppose your activation is something similar to that of an organic human birth: long expected but still a surprise when it finally happens."  

Arthur led him down a comfortably lit hallway to a dining room with large paneled windows overlooking a cityscape shrouded in a dark and drumming storm. Near the window stood Dr. Belloc, watching as they entered. Seated at the far end of a long dining table in the center of the room was a woman.  

"Hello, Damien," she said with a smile as she stood up and crossed the room offering her hand which Damien awkwardly shook. It was warm to the touch and her grip was strong but somehow encouraging. His first true human contact.  

"I'm Alexandra More, the Chief Executive Officer here at ITAM & Co. How do you feel?"  

"I feel good, ma'am" he responded.  

"Oh, great, I'm glad to hear that. I've been very excited at the chance to meet you. Please, have a seat. And you can call me Alex," she beamed at him as he sat down at the table.    

"And if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask." She resumed her seat and paused for a moment before speaking. Dr. Belloc observed silently from his position by the window.  

"This all must be so new to you" she started with another smile. "Everything all at once, with no time to process it...I can't even imagine... We really are truly glad that you are with us now, Damien."  

Again she paused carefully searching for the words to use.  

"As it happens, this is...unprecedented territory for us as well" nodding toward Dr. Belloc, "so we will proceed discreetly. You are...the singular result of the work of hundreds of individuals."  

"I'm a...project?" he asked, remembering Arthur's earlier comment.  

"You're a person" came the firm response from More. "A person, a human. Like me and Dr. Belloc," gesturing towards the figure standing by the window. "You're one of us." A heavily muffled boom of thunder punctuated her statement.  

"But I'm still different, aren't I?"  

"The only true difference is that you were deliberately brought into this world, which if you think about it, really is the way many of us human-born individuals come about." She smiled reassuringly again.  

"Why don't I tell you a bit about what brought you here?" she said, changing the subject having satisfied herself with having soothed Damiano's concerns. Damien nodded. "We, ITAM, are a company that was founded centuries ago in this very city, Bellefonte, in this very building, the Old Match Factory. The goal of the undertaking was simple at its core: to bring order to society. To achieve this end, the company sought to optimize human ingenuity and enhance natural systems in the world."  

"Human history is marred by the bloodshed of war, perpetual pain, and innumerable self-inflicted injuries throughout the centuries - never learning the lesson. Our history as a species is a tragic and even evil one - our capacity for violence towards one another and our world is unparalleled in the universe. ITAM sought to throw off these chains and move humanity forward to its truest fulfillment by providing guidance against such acts."  

"Basically, we are building products that are "societal-facing" and that seek to solve our deepest issues to bring about meaningful change. It sounds like marketing-speak, but it's very true."  

"You'll soon find out you have been given abilities-" More started, but Dr. Belloc took a quick step forward. More glanced over at Belloc before continuing in a measured manner, "...but...you are still early in your development. You are young and full of immense potential; potential to help us." Dr. Belloc stepped back and resumed his neutral stance but his eyes were fixed on Ms. More's face looking ready to pounce on her very words. His face was calm.  

Leaning forward, More looked intently into Damiano's eyes from across the table, "Will you help us in our mission?" Both More and Dr. Belloc were now fixated on Damien, waiting for his response.  

He felt a flush of nervousness and excitement in his chest at the invitation. While he did not fully, truly understand this company's mission or his place in it, he wanted to learn more about it and this world he had been brought into. He wanted to help them.  

"Yes," he replied.  

"Excellent!" More responded, beaming warmly at him. Both onlookers visibly relaxed. "Well, now that we have that out of the way, we have a big day tomorrow so you better go get some sleep. Have your robot bring you a snack before bed, I'm sure you're hungry."  

As Damiano stood to leave, More said, "We can answer all of your questions tomorrow at length. For now, I just want you to know that we're very happy that you're here with us, Damien."    

More looked towards Dr. Belloc who nodded in agreement.  

"Thank you," said Damien and followed Arthur down the hallway to a small but comfortable bedroom.  

After wolfing down the snack of banana bread Arthur brought him and completing his toiletries, Damiano crawled into bed. It was a lovely feeling, curling between the mattress and the blankets. Despite the myriad of questions swirling about in his mind, it did not take long for his eyes to close for the first sleep of his life.
