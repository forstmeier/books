Peter moved off to the far side of the speeding skiff to be as far away from his traveling companions as possible. It was apparent looking over the side that they were moving too high and fast to safely jump from the ship. Plus, they were in the middle of nowhere and it was a certainty he would be scooped back up immediately.

Still hovering over his shoulder, Millie reached up to her mouth and pantomimed tearing something away from her face, as if she had been wearing a muzzle - her whole image jittered as she did so. "Whew" she gasped, her ability to speak restored, "finally got that program off." Millie took a few steps forward, along an invisible ground, and looked over the edge herself.

"You know I didn't have anything to do with this, right?" she asked turning to him. "I honestly have no idea what's going on with this...kidnapping." Millie continued, "Lewis instigated quite a lot of violence to get us away from More and Belloc."

Peter agreed with that assessment. But Millie had also been assigned to him by Lewis - it was possible she was also acting on the kidnapper's orders. Drawing his legs in he pulled himself into a ball and with his chin on his knees he stared at the deck of the skiff. Millie bent down and reached out a holographic hand to comfort him.

The three-dimensional image of light created no true sensation as she ran her hand through his hair but...concern and genuine worry was being conveyed by the artificial intelligence unit.

"Should we try to escape?" he asked picking up his head up.

"Possibly," she said as she straightened up and glanced across at Lewis still at work on his tablet. "Wait right here and I'll attempt to get a communication out. It's highly probable that he has erected some sort of blackout or message jamming so it may take some time."

"That does raise the question though:" turning back towards Peter, "why would he bring me if he knows I have the potential to establish a beacon?" She looked at Peter for a moment and then disappeared into the wind. The AI certainly appeared to be on his side, and displayed a genuine care for his well-being, but like she said, her powers were likely already accounted for by Lewis making her a non-factor in the current situation.
