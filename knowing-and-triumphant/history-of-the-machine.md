Lewis moved down a short hallway into the next room with the group again in tow.

"In the early years" continued Lewis, "the demand for the company's services grew rapidly. So rapidly, in fact, that it grew beyond the control of the individuals running the firm which created conflicts and redundancies within the operation. A unifying force within the company was called for - this would become the single most important piece of technology utilized by the firm to this day."

"The program that was built had access to the entire firm and all of its projects and employees. It has grown to become a driving force to our continued success. It balances between directly and indirectly providing action items and guidance to the firm as it sees that it is needed. In a lot of ways, it's a demigod behind the organization and has been exposed externally as a service itself - our main service."

The group arrived in a room that was but similarly rounded but smaller and with a lower ceiling. Plush couch benches lined the walls and suspended from the ceiling were several pieces of equipment which were being manipulated by thin, white robots.

Stopping before the door at the far end of the room he turned to the others.

"Clearance restrictions dictate that the rest of you must remain here," he said, gesturing at the others. "Only the Proctor Hopeful and a Chairman may proceed any further."

More and Belloc looked at each other worriedly. More took a step forward and opened her mouth to speak. Lewis shot her a look of pure steel.

The robots which had been attending the hanging apparatuses looked up sharply as if sensing Lewis's silent rapprochement. Reading his face, and the situation, More carefully stepped back.

Belloc spoke up unexpectedly, with a quiet force that resounded in the silent room, "We'll be waiting for you."

Lewis nodded and passed through the door which slid open to receive him and Damiano. Down another hallway, this one dark and only dimly lit, was yet another circular room again smaller than the one before it. It was empty save for a convolution of pipes running along the ceiling and disappearing into the far wall. Several readout panels were scattered along the whitewashed walls and blinked out information steadily.

A low door was opposite them in the room, shorter than the average door, it would force Lewis to duck slightly should he go through it.

"And this is where I leave you," said Lewis stopping before the door. "You must go on alone but through that door, you will learn about the extent of your mission here. Our own little 'Door of Humility' - what lies beyond is beyond you."
