Peter snapped back into consciousness, gasping in shock.

His heart was racing in his chest.

The last thing he remembered was...the needles...the procedure.

He forced himself to take a deep breath, and then another. Gradually, his body calmed down and he began to take in where he was. It was a different room from where the operation had taken place; there was no constant, almost imperceptible, low hum of the systems on _Lunella_ so he must be back on _Pangea_.

Sitting up, he looked about the dimly lit room. He was on a hospital-style bed but there was no equipment about. The medical gown he wore to the operation was gone and he was now dressed in a gray, fitted bodysuit and light shoes. One door was open in the room and it led down a hallway lit by faint white lights.

Peter slid from the bed and walked carefully down the hall. At the end was a small room and in the center stood a full suit of combat armor behind a plated glass display case.

A side door opened and Arthur stepped through. He was wearing combat armor with several plats and pieces of equipment strapped to his metal frame.

"Hello, sir, how are you feeling?" asked Arthur, cheerful as always.

"I'm okay. A little sore though."

"That is to be expected given the arduous procedure," said Arthur matter-of-factly. "It should wear off in time and I should warn you that you may now begin experiencing your previously dormant capabilities as the Proctor."

Arthur tapped a holographic panel next to the display case which slid up and away into the ceiling. He stepped forward and began retrieving pieces from the set.

"This is for you, sir" proffering them to Peter.

"Why?"

The concern in his voice must have shown through as Arthur changed his tone to a more reassuring one.

"You are in no immediate danger, this is merely a precaution that has been ordered for you."

"By whom?"

Arthur froze briefly before responding.

"Unfortunately, sir, I am unable to divulge that at this time."
