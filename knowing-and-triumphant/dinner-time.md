Before long they again came to a grassland and a little further beyond they arrived at a small building. Upon disembarking and a closer inspection, it appeared to have been specifically prepared to accommodate visitors.

Arthur set about cooking dinner on a compact mobile kitchen while Peter helped him fetch various utensils and ingredients. The robot chatted amiably but Peter remained mostly silent, still processing everything that had happened that day. After helping unpack, Lewis kept to himself and only observed their interactions from a distance. Once the meal was ready they ate in silence around the fire Lewis had lit.

"May I take that?" asked Peter suddenly, pointing at a small grass skimmer hovering just off the ground anchored next to the house.

Lewis nodded.

Lewis had just given him a way out, a means of escape. Either that meant he trusted him now or there was no longer a reason for him to remain with Lewis. Likely the latter. And somehow, Peter wasn't really surprised by Lewis's response. He'd already known he would say yes. And he already knew he didn't want to try and escape.
