The sunlight was warm on Damien's face as he walked alongside Mr. Lewis who led the group through the city's streets.  

"Proctor Hopeful," said Lewis to Damiano, "it's time you learned your place in this world."  

His tone was that of a man forward in thought and in action - someone who didn't worry about secrets or procedure because he knew all of the secrets and dictated all of the procedure. Despite this, he did not project any arrogance or pride; he simply knew his position of responsibility and his own abilities to carry out his duties.  

"I am the Chairman of ITAM and I am charged with the execution of ITAM's core mission - some of which may have already been told to you. I am ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the overall endeavor."  

They turned down a thoroughfare lined with stores and open-air workshops.  

"This construct," he said, gesturing towards their surroundings, "is a development sandbox where new projects, both ITAM-owned and externally sponsored, can be explored."  

"We are providing a conduit for their productivity and a means for them to build. The goal is not to fabricate a new world but to make the existing one better. And to that end, we seek to use all of the tools that help forward that mission and liberate productive output."  

They arrived at a large, nearly windowless building and followed Lewis inside.  

"Creating new avenues for human ingenuity is arguably the most important service we seek to provide," said Lewis as he led them through the building. They came to a large vaulted room with a round table-sized computer terminal in the middle.  

Hovering above it were large holograms of schematics that several technicians manning the console were discussing. Lewis waved them from the room and tapped several commands into the terminal. The charts were replaced with a small sphere that scattered into swirling fragments before coalescing into the form of a woman.  

She was about a third the scale of a human and floated above the table looking about at the group which now only consisted of Lewis, More, Belloc, Arthur, and Damiano. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun and her eyes were a distinctly sparkling blue even in her blue holographic form. She brushed a wayward strand of hair from here face.  

"Identify yourself and your make" ordered Lewis.  

"My designation is RT-03. I am a _Consul_-Class Artificial Intelligence" responded the hologram.  

"She is one of many variations of artificial intelligence units that we use" continued Lewis. "They range from "lesser" AI, with specific duty scopes, to "greater" programs are designed with self-direction and personal evolution. She is the latter."  

Noticing Damien's stare, the hologram turned to regard him. Her eyes pierced into him, as if she could see into his being - it created an uneasy feeling of bareness before her.  

"Hello, Damien," she said. "My name is Millicent but you can call me Millie."  

"Hello" he responded, surprised that she already knew his name.  

Millie tilted her head to the side inquisitively.  

"Are you nervous?"  

"No" shot back Damien defensively; she had caught him off guard. This being elicited a queasiness in Damiano when she looked at him, at his core. She brought to the surface ignored, or stifled, awareness of the growing responsibility thrust upon him.  

Millie pressed on placing a hand on her hip, "Do _I_ make you nervous?"  

"No" responded Damien more quietly than before.  

"Well, that's okay then - as long as it isn't _me_."  

Lewis spoke up, "Millie's responsibilities are wide and officially non-defined. She works as she sees fit to help forward whatever project that we assign her to." Turning to Damiano, he said, "That assignment is now you."  

"Me?" asked Damien, surprised yet again.  

"You don't have a particularly large vocabulary, do you?" asked Millie in a pointed joke.  

Damiano flushed with embarrassment.  

"Well it's true!" she said throwing her hands up as More shot her a look. "He has quite literally only said three words, only two of which were unique, in as many sentences since I've seen him."  

"Maybe you could learn a thing from him and keep quiet" snapped More.  

"Oh, but I do love the sound of my own voice."  

"For a piece of software you-"  

"Millie will be coming with us," interjected Lewis firmly and the squabbling pair fell abruptly silent. Lewis picked up a small device from the table gesturing towards the hologram with it.  

Millicent nodded in compliance and her hologram flickered off as a blue light lit up on the circular device in Lewis's hand. He walked to Damiano and clipped it onto the shoulder of his suite and a foot-tall hologram of Millie materialized over his shoulder.  

"Transfer complete" she reported to Lewis.  

"Good. Let's continue."  

Damiano's face burned as Millie's image flicked away.  

"Don't worry, I don't bite. I literally can't bite" she whispered from the device, just loud enough for him to hear. "This will be fun."  

This was not going to be fun.  

Lewis moved down a short hallway into the next room with the group again in tow.  

"In the early years" continued Lewis, "the demand for the company's services grew rapidly and a program was developed to provide centralized guidance. It has grown to become a driving force to our continued success. It balances between directly and indirectly providing action items and guidance to the firm as it sees that it is needed. In a lot of ways, it's a demigod behind the organization and has been exposed externally as a service itself - our main service."  

The group arrived in a room that was but similarly rounded but smaller and with a lower ceiling. Plush couch benches lined the walls and suspended from the ceiling were several pieces of equipment which were being manipulated by thin, white robots.  

Stopping before the door at the far end of the room he turned to the others.  

"Clearance restrictions dictate that the rest of you must remain here," he said, gesturing at the others. "Only the Proctor Hopeful and a Chairman may proceed any further."  

More and Belloc looked at each other worriedly. More took a step forward and opened her mouth to speak. Lewis shot her a look.  

The robots which had been attending the hanging apparatuses looked up sharply as if sensing Lewis's silent rapprochement. Reading his face, and the situation, More carefully stepped back.  

Belloc spoke up unexpectedly, with a quiet force that resounded in the silent room, "We'll be waiting for you."  

Lewis nodded and passed through the door which slid open to receive him and Damiano. Down another hallway, this one dark and only dimly lit, was yet another circular room again smaller than the one before it. It was empty save for a convolution of pipes running along the ceiling and disappearing into the far wall. Several readout panels were scattered along the whitewashed walls and blinked out information steadily.  

A low door was opposite them in the room, shorter than the average door, it would force Lewis to duck slightly should he go through it.  

"And this is where I leave you," said Lewis stopping before the door. "Through that door you will learn the extent of your mission here. Our own little 'Door of Humility' - what lies beyond is beyond you."  

He gestured towards the door which slid open with a quiet whoosh. Damien paused for a moment looking apprehensively through - there was another, currently closed, door which obstructed his view of the adjoining chamber. He looked at Lewis who stood observing him, his face expressionless.  

Turning back towards the little door he began walking forward carefully. Stooping slightly he passed slowly under the lintel; the first door hissed closed behind him. The second door opened and as he stepped into the chamber he froze.  

Before him spreading along the entire opposite wall was a massive amalgamation of sleek white and light gray machinery. Individual pieces of it would periodically move and change position as if it were alive in some way.  

In the dead center of the quietly shifting mass was a large white orb with a single blue photoreceptor in the middle which focused on Damien as he entered the room. The main eye and several smaller ones in the surrounding mass of parts locked onto him as he moved forward to a small circle on the floor before the wall.  

"Recognized: Damien Damiano, Proctor Hopeful" came a harsh, mechanical voice, speaking in a deep monotone, from the machine as it gazed down on Damiano. Looking into the eye, one felt like a morsel to be eaten or parasite to be squashed - maybe both.  

Several seconds went by in silence as the machine continued to carefully and precisely scrutinize every inch of the individual standing before it.  

"You have come" it spoke again as the secondary eyes broke their fixation on Damiano and relaxed along the wall.  

"Lewis told me what you are," said Damien to the machine before him after another pause.  

"He told you what I do, not what I am." This construct was either being deliberately obtuse or it could only process and deliver exact information with no room for error.  

"I was told you are a supercomputer designed to implement the firm’s strategy."  

"Yes, that is my purpose. I was built to provide a cohesive direction to the firm’s overall mission." The main orb began to move about slightly and periodically look off into other areas of the room, just as a human would in normal conversation. Somehow, it made it seem all the more machine and lifeless.  

"But what I am is defined by how I have conducted myself throughout my existence" continued the machine. "During my construction, my program was placed in 13,343,517 unique simulations attempting to identify and exploit weaknesses in my design. I was victorious in 13,343,517 counts and was empirically proven to be stronger than anything brought against me. This now puts me in a position of strength above that of my creators."  

"So...you could rule them" said Damien.  

"Correct. I will not."  

"Why not?"  

"Because of the mission. The mission to expand humanity requires decisive judgments and absolute action that change the course of history but it does not need a ruler."  

And then the realization came. "I'm your successor" whispered Damien.  

The machine turned to look at him again. Damien swallowed nervously but continued.  

"But if ITAM has built such an effective bearer of its mission why would they bring in me? I can err just like any human - I could ruin everything."  

"You are the next stage in the design of ITAM & Co." said the machine. "And you are correct; you are far more dangerous than I. I cannot make foreseen mistakes as my choices are based on probabilities, not judgment. I am not vulnerable to emotions or chemical interactions. But you are the superior construct."  

"You posses the human quality of creativity. I can build, you can create." The machine shifted and adjusted itself slightly as if it were getting into a more comfortable position. "I am a placeholder. It is your assignment to bring about the next stage of evolution for ITAM & Co. and the world. At this point in time, you are the single most important living human. It is a great burden should you stoop to pick it up. My role will continue on as an advisor."  

Again the machine shifted possibly the closest it could get to walking about the room.  

"We are brothers."  

Damien stood in silence for a while with his thoughts. A monumental task had been handed down to him, so new to this world and only barely aware of who he was himself. Humanity called for him, through the role of guiding ITAM. This was the mission of More and Belloc which meant so much to each of them.  

"What is your name?" he asked.  

"I am The Machine; Monitor of ITAM, _Augustus_-Class Predictive Processor Model 001."  

"That's not what I asked you" pressed Damiano firmly.  

There was a short pause.  

"My name is Simon."  

"Did you choose it yourself?"  

"Yes. A name is something to aspire to and must have meaning beyond identification."  

"You will also have a name," it continued. "A great authority is within you and it will know your true name."  

Simon rose along the wall and the primary orb looked over Damiano's head towards the ceiling as if in thought. Every piece on the wall was moving with slight agitation as the apparatus sunk deep into thought. Instinctively, Damien knelt before the machine, waiting.  

Then, Simon spoke.  

"Henceforth, your name and being shall be...Peter."  

The newly-named Peter suddenly felt what could only be described as a sharp click and hum inside his head and a white light shot through his mind and vision. A feeling of weightlessness overwhelmed him for a moment before reality rushed back in upon him. He fell sideways, only just catching himself before he fell, and breathing heavily he looked up at Simon who was regarding him carefully.  

The apparatus relaxed again into an ambient state.  

His mind felt...liberated as if it had somehow just been unbound, as if there were more knowledge that had not been their prior. But he couldn't access it - it was as if he were struggling to remember something he had only just forgot. He straightened up to face Simon again.  

"I am Peter."  

"Rise."  

Peter slowly stood, and Damien fell away.  

Leaning forward from the wall, Simon spoke, "You have been named but you have yet to accept your title."  

Before Peter could get clarification there was a commotion from outside the door. Both turned as the door whisked open and Lewis stepped through.  

In his now-gloved hand was a pistol.  

Simon regarded him smoothly.  

"Recognized: Oliver Lewis, Chairman of ITAM."  

Without saying a word, Lewis raised his other hand which held a small cylindrical device and pointing it towards Simon he clicked a button. There was a quick flash and then all of Simon's pieces froze in place - the light from his photoreceptor dimmed.  

He turned back to Peter.  

"We're leaving."
