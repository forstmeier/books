Arthur led them down a series of hallways and stairways until they came to a high-ceiling conference room and entered through the only door. A large chandelier hung above the long table filling the majority of the room.

At the far end sat Lewis by himself.

He was sitting passively in dark robes with his hands folded in his lap below the table; he seemed to be deep in thought with his head slightly bowed.

To one side stood More with a small contingent of armed soldiers. Now she was also wearing armor, similar to the light construction of Peter's. A helmet was cradled in the crook of her arm and her hair was now pulled back into two buns low on her head as if ready for action.

She smiled faintly at Peter as he entered and took up a place standing across the table from her.

It again felt oddly reminiscent of the first time he met her. Where previously his nervousness had been quelled by the kindness of the few people he knew in the world, they were now the source of his apprehension.

Millie materialized over Peter's shoulder as if to assure him of her presence while Arthur took up a position on his other side.

"How do you feel, Peter? Are you okay?" asked More breaking the silence.

"Yes. It hurt but I'm okay now."

More gave Peter another weak smile.

"I'm glad that part is over."
