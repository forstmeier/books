Peter pushed himself back to his feet using his sword as a crutch. His sword hung loosely in his hand at his side. He was exhausted.

Belloc knew it and he wasn't about to waste time with some diatribe. He drew his sword back preparing to lunge and then, igniting his boosters, shot forward. Peter brought his blade to the defense and the duelists were at it again.

Attack and parry, blow after blow. It was nothing beautiful as neither was an experienced swordsman. Sheer purpose drove their energy.

Belloc pushed Peter back again. A sudden feint got past the exhausted Peter's defenses. The butt of Belloc's sword smashed into the side of his head, sending Peter stumbling. He barely raised his blade in time to block another downward slash.

Everything was moving in slow motion.

His head hung loosely from his shoulders.

Why keep fighting? What was the point? Fighting was exactly what he wanted to prevent but to prevent it he caused it. The only way to stop it was to give in.

Darkness enveloped him, coldness touched his soul. There was nothing and it consumed him.

"Peter, I'm here with you."

Millie's voice cut through the dark shroud on his mind; he heard her voice but she hadn't spoken.

He could feel her strength and fire, trueness and soundness. Her utter stoicism and strength of being, a being of passion. And now he could feel that same purpose within his own heart but defining him uniquely.

Peter could now see himself.

He was a seeker of truth, a being of duty, a servant to man. He was Peter and he was the Proctor. All this flew through his mind in a brief moment. Looking up through the crossed blades a renewed sense of purpose flooded through his veins.
