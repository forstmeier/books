> Dear Mr. Lewis,  
>  
> First allow me to congratulate you on your recent success in finally producing a Proctor Hopeful; this is truly an unparalleled contribution to our organization's endeavors in this world. You have the deepest thanks and admiration of myself, the leadership, and all of ITAM & Co.  
>  
> Unfortunately, this is not the primary reason for which I am contacting you.  
>  
> It has come to the attention of the Oversight Committee that you or members of your staff have been engaging in an effort to subvert the objective of the Proctor program. Because of this, we require that you immediately hand over all access information and documentation surrounding the Proctor initiative for review by this Committee and that you return to the Bellefonte office for questioning.  
>  
> You are hereby suspended from your role and rights as Chairman pending the results of the ongoing investigation into your activities. An interim Chairman will be selected in due course. At this time:  
>  
> * You will return to your office on _Pangea_ and remain there until you are retrieved by our officers  
> * All access tokens, both for your position and for the project, are to be relinquished to the above mentioned officers  
> * You will refrain from accessing any part of the ITAM network or members thereof  
>  
> I do hope that this matter can be resolved swiftly and economically. The Proctor Hopeful will be allowed to naturally assume its position within ITAM & Co. without any untoward intervention. Do not test this Committee.  
>  
> Regards,
