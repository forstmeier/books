Peter lowered his head and quietly asked, "Could I be alone for a minute?"

The two adults exchanged another look. More gently touched Peter's shoulder in reassurance before turning and leaving the room with Belloc. Arthur remained by the door silently attending.

Peter looked about the room not really seeing anything and just too overwhelmed to think. The weight of the world pressed down on his shoulders.

He felt like he wanted to cry. He was completely alone. Everyone was looking to him, expecting him to lead when he himself had no idea of his own ability. He was expected to shoulder a role he never asked for.

As if sensing his mood, Arthur stepped forward comfortingly. Millie, who had remained silent but present up to this point, spoke up.

"This is a great responsibility you have and it's one you never asked for. A daunting mantle to carry forward humanity."

"It's difficult but it doesn't mean its impossible" she continued in a soft voice. "Be strong. This is the start of your greatest test: the test of life. You heard and learned of the intent of the others and yes, everything beyond this point is ultimately your decision, but there will be people there with you, to help you. There will be many enormous decisions waiting for you, every day of your life, but we will be there to help you."

Arthur spoke up, "I may not always appear to be a your adjunct, but I have been charged with protecting and supporting your person and I feel that even beyond this order, I wish to do good in your service. We will be here for you, Proctor Hopeful."

Peter still felt wretchedly nervous. He was at the center of a tug-of-war between opposing forces - he was the knot they needed to pull to their side in order to win. Their motives were obvious now.

He thought over the factions again, Lewis, More, and Belloc. How would he know how to balance which was right or even if any of them were right at all?

"I'll always be with you" whispered Millie in his ear.
