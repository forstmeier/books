More brought Peter up to a dining room on the upper floors of the building. Open archways led to a balcony encircling the room and overlooking the landscape in a full three-sixty degree view. It sort of reminded Peter of the tower where he had first met More and Belloc in Bellefonte. This was a much more pleasant view for sure.

Belloc sat down with Peter at the table and performed a cursory medical examination. Satisfied with the results, he leaned back and nodded to More who was slowly pacing the length of the dining table. Her agitation was palpable; having her charge, Peter, torn violently from her a day prior had upset her greatly.

"We were worried about you," said More breaking the silence. "After your abduction, we immediately launched a search but it was difficult with our communications network down. You probably noticed that yourself as your AI couldn't reach out to us despite her best efforts."

At that, Millie materialized over his shoulder. More nodded her thanks to Millie who reciprocated the gesture.

"This medical center was one of the first places we checked" continued More. "We conducted a perimeter sweep but with no results, we locked down the facility, as per procedure, and moved on across the surface. Only this morning we were finally able to establish your location after getting the network back online."

Placing her hands on the table she leaned forward looking deeply into Peter's face.

"We didn't know what he would do with you."

"I didn't know, either" responded Peter. "But he treated me well other than the kidnapping."

"We're very thankful for that," said More, glancing at the silent Belloc.
