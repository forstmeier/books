Again, the skiff drifted past the scene below them and onto the next. Before them was nothing but large, barren tracts of exposed metal framework arching away into the unbroken horizon. Was the atmosphere around them thinning? Or was it a lack of reflective surroundings to provide additional light? Either way, the enormous metal beams and troughs below them returned only a dull glint from the sun above which now appeared more like a dispassionate orb than a warming and sky-filling light.

Lewis broke the silence.

"We need to discuss your role in this world."

Peter bristled.

"I've already been told it by Simon."

Lewis opened his mouth and then closed it taking a moment to formulate his response.

"He's your older brother in many ways and yes he knows what you'll go through. But I am the one who knows why you are here and you are here because I ordered it. I ordered your creation through the Machine."

That was it. The kidnapping went well beyond any long-term plan that could have possibly been laid out. It had been the known and expected from the moment Peter was first dreamed up. The control the chairman had over him didn't stop at their present predicament. His grip reached into the very core of Peter's existence.

Lewis seemed to sense Peter's disquiet and continued in a more comforting tone. "It wasn't on some whim, Peter."

That was the first time Lewis had said his name. Until now it had been "Proctor Hopeful" or no name at all. That struck a chord with Peter, something personal. It was as if Lewis had very intentionally set aside his role as Chairman responsible for a project and finally approached him as a person.

Lewis was leaning forward now, eyes fixed on Peter's. "There's more to you than simply fitting into Simon's role of managing ITAM. ITAM has an enormous presence in human affairs and it seeks to help all mankind."

"This makes you a leader of men. That's a role no one is simply born into, no matter how much careful planning is put into their conception. No, that is something that is built on trial and error. You must learn your role through what only your human experience can afford you."

Involuntarily, Peter began relax. Curiosity began to return seeing this great world unfold around him. Curiosity too about the things that Lewis was saying. Curiosity and nervousness at the immensity of the job being asked.

"How will I know what the right thing to do is?" he asked weakly, almost to himself.

Lewis stood up from his seat and walked to the bow. Looking over the emptiness he replied, "It is difficult to say. We live in a world of relativity. Different people with different experiences, choices, lives. Separately we are individuals but still bound by absolutes."

He paused a moment.

"I believe we live in a world where humans bear a set of intrinsic rights. One of the most important of these is the right of the individual to self-direction. Beings of reason demand freedom. Balancing this and other fundamental privileges can be difficult. It is hard enough for the individual in day-to-day life and it will be even greater in your role as your choices will envelope many lives. That question will arise every single day of your life."

"Can your authority be wielded to end suffering and to provide structure to this world? Can those fundamental rights of freedom be sacrificed? You will have to answer these questions every day. Just like the rest of us."

Lewis turned back to Peter who had been intently watching him as he stood looking across the landscape.

"I did not put you here, into your position, lightly," he said with an earnest intonation, almost begging Peter to believe him. "I know that I'm asking the world of you."

He was silent for a while.
