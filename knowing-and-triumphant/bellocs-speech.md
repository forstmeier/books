"Come with me" spoke Dr. Belloc from behind Damiano and led him back through the lounge and up a spiral staircase in the corner to an observation deck in the upper hull of the spaceship. A sprawling starscape unfolded above them as they gazed up through the glass.

"It has taken a long time and a great deal of human effort to bring us here," said Belloc, with his eyes fixed on the expanse above them. "This company has stood for decades as major contributing factor towards peace in this world; our mandate has been one of service." A proud tone colored his words.

"Everything from human organization to military strategy to fiscal policy falls into our operational scope. Negotiations, succession arbitration, combat operations, and more. Corporations, nations, and even religious institutions form our client base and yet we could grow much further."

"What's stopping you?" asked Damien after a moment.

For the first time since he began speaking, Dr. Belloc dropped his eyes from the starscape and looked off into the corner of the observatory. "People who don't want to be helped" he sighed; the very notion seemed to trouble his mood "and who are unwilling to do what is necessary to grow."

"Our sole purpose as part of ITAM is to help people to build a better world for themselves and their future generations yet so many choose to actively work against us and against their fellow man."

He turned and looked Damiano in the eye.

"So many simply choose to abandon their gift of reason, to merely exist with no true desire to answer the call of humanity. We must press on with any advantage that we may have against these...ideologies, if they can even be classified as such; it is our duty not only to ITAM but to the world. We must be the necessary structure in this world because we have the capacity to be so" he said, turning his gaze upon the starfield once again.
