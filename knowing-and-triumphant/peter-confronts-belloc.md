Below him, he noticed that Belloc's Mover was moving less "organically"; it was still watching him but its arms had become less active and were not bracing to swing at him. It was as if it had settled into a "passive" mode. The autopilot must have been activated. A few moments later, a hatch opened on its upper shoulder and a figure emerged.

Belloc.

He was clad head to toe in a full armor battle suit. He looked up and stared calmly at the flying Peter.

"He wants to fight," said Millie.

"Clearly."

"He's confident he has the playing field skewed in his favor. Otherwise he wouldn't face you if he didn't think he had a way to win. But...this is probably your only chance of achieving victory in this thing."

Peter thought for a moment and then dove towards the plate Belloc was standing on. He lighted a little ways away from Belloc, his helmet retracted exposing his face to the wind.

"We could avoid this, Peter," said Belloc.

It was the first time he had ever used his name.

"Step down and come with me. Back to us, to More."

"There is nothing for me there."

"There is peace, security, all of that is yours, all of that you can provide. You are the Proctor."

"What is it you think you've done?!" shouted Peter. "There is no peace - you started a war for me!"

"It was the only way; it had to be done."

"Then your way is wrong," said Peter, firmly.

"You are refusing to surrender," said Belloc - a statement, not a question.

"I must do my duty."

Belloc pursed his lips, "As must I."
