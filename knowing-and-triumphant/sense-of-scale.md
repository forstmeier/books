"What?"

"All of this - the constructed world around you."

"It's big, I guess" Peter responded in an annoyed tone.

Lewis ignored his attitude. "It's sheer size still amazes me," said Lewis in agreement. "I have worked with ITAM for decades and it was under initial planning when I first started with the company.

He paused for a moment, "Are you hungry?"

Peter nodded despite himself.

Lewis reached into a travel bag at his feet and produced several sealed ration packets. The two ate in silence while Lewis continued gazing across the landscape.
