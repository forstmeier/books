Awaiting them on the platform was a lone man and while the majority of the retinue dispersed Belloc and More strode over to meet him.

His dark clothes stood out from the landing port backdrop. He carried himself very upright and a steady gaze rested upon the approaching party; he emanated authority.

"Mr. Lewis," said Ms. More as she extended her hand towards the man "it is good to see you again."

He briefly shook her hand.

"Thank you, Alex."

She paused, a little surprised at his brusqueness of his tone, before stepping back. Belloc nodded in greeting but Lewis barely registered the acknowledgment. There was a tension between the two of them and Lewis.

"We weren't expecting a welcome reception," said More with a smile, apparently trying to cajole a more genial mood out of Lewis. "Hopefully we didn't keep you waiting."

"Not at all" replied Lewis evenly.

"Well, I'm glad to hear it! Even if it is a wonderful day to be caught outside."

"Quite. Where is our guest?"

More shifted, nearly imperceptibly to place her body between Lewis and himself.

"He is still very new to the world-"

"I understand that" interjected Lewis, cutting her off mid-sentence. "But we are here for him, and him alone."

With a look over at Belloc, she reluctantly turned and motioned for Damiano to step forward.

"This is Damien."

Lewis turned his gaze towards Damiano who continued to eye him warily. He beckoned him to come closer.

As he began to approach Lewis took a swift step forward placing them nearly face-to-face. Lewis looked intently into Damien's eyes without saying a word. Damien defiantly stared back.

After a few tense moments, Lewis spoke.

"Very well then," he said, without breaking eye contact, "let's begin the tour."
