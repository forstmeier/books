His little internal revelry was cut short by what lay before him on the platform. A long, sleek vehicle with swept-back wings perched on the landing pad balancing gracefully on its landing gear. Painted in maroon and off-white, it looked serene against the stormy, gray sky above it.

More walked towards the ramp extending from the ship's belly under its pair of massive engines. Damiano hurriedly ran to catch up with her realizing that he had stopped in amazement to take in the scene.

"Where are we going?" he asked excitedly.

Ms. More turned and smiled at him with a laughing twinkle in her eye. "Oh, wouldn't you just love to know?" and with a little chuckle turned and disappeared up the ramp; despite her coyness, More was good company. She was a genuinely friendly spirit.

Following her up into the belly of the ship, Damiano found a compact but comfortable lounge. Belloc came in behind him and, as the rest of the retinue disappeared with their luggage elsewhere in the ship, brought him forward to the cockpit.

The pilots were in the midst of preparing to launch and Damiano could see through the expansive canopy the shadowy spires of the Bellefonte skyline surrounding the landing pad. A voice came over the intercom, "Sloop _Bendlerblock_, you are cleared for liftoff."

"Copy tower control; initiating launch sequence."

The pilot flipped a final switch and Damiano felt a soft rumble throughout the ship; a muffled whine crescendoed as the engines ignited. There was a slight shake and then, through the viewport, Damiano could see the platform beginning to drop out from beneath them as they lifted off. After a few moments of gradual ascent, the ship began to accelerate forward and upwards as the pilot guided them towards the sky.

Below, the cityscape began to fall away and was quickly shrouded from view as they glided into the gray clouds above. For a few moments, Damiano could see nothing except clouds from the cockpit. But then, in an instant, they broke through.

Above them was an endless blue expanse...growing darker...becoming black...and then...stars. Point after point of light began poking through the inky darkness until the entire field was ablaze.

It was beautiful.

He turned and looked down and could see the clouds falling away. The horizon became a curve and gradually collapsed into a sphere - a planet appeared below them with clouds and mountains and blue seas. They were now in open space.
