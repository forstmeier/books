When Damien woke it was still dark outside - the storm from the night before had not completely passed and he could see raindrops faintly falling onto the bedroom window. After washing and dressing he walked with Arthur down the hallway to the dining room.

Breakfast was waiting for him, as were More and Belloc, cheerful and silent, respectively. More made small talk and kept Damiano in good company while Dr. Belloc seemed content with his cup of coffee and hand tablet all the while keeping a watchful eye on the pair.

"Well," said More as they finished, "we need to get moving if we're going to keep our schedule." A small group of attendants and robots entered from the opposite hallway carrying various pieces of equipment and luggage. Belloc began directing them about as More turned to Damiano. "We have a short bit of travel ahead of us - are you ready to go?"

"Yes, I am!" said Damiano.

"Great!" laughed More. "It looks like Dr. Belloc has everything prepared for departure so let's get a move on." With that she strode out of the room beckoning Damien to join her; the retinue fell in behind them.

Through the windows it was heavily overcast and raining slightly - he wondered if it were a perpetual storm or at least if there were any other weather patterns. For him, it had quite literally lasted his entire waking life. At the end of the hallway, they arrived at a door which opened up to an outdoor platform.

Cool, fresh air met Damiano for the first time. The rain sprinkled down onto his face.

Even though liquid had been his first tangible, physical experience within the container, this was somehow different. It was alive and natural, simple but untamed. It was beautiful.

His little internal revelry was cut short by what lay before him on the platform. A long, sleek vehicle with sweeping wings stretching out from its body perched on the landing pad balancing gracefully on its landing gear. Painted in maroon and off-white, it looked almost serene against the stormy, gray sky above it.

More walked towards the ramp extending from the ship's belly out from under its pair of massive engines. Damiano hurriedly ran to catch up with her realizing that he had stopped in amazement to take in the scene.

"Where are we going?" he asked excitedly.

Ms. More turned and smiled at him with a laughing twinkle in her eye. "Oh, wouldn't you just love to know?" and with a little chuckle turned and disappeared up the ramp; despite her coyness, More was good company. She was a genuinely friendly spirit.

Following her up into the belly of the ship, Damiano found a compact but comfortable lounge. Belloc came in behind him and, as the rest of the retinue disappeared with their luggage elsewhere in the ship, brought him forward to the cockpit.

The pilots were in the midst of preparing to launch and Damiano could see through the expansive canopy the shadowy spires of the Bellefonte skyline surrounding the landing pad. A voice came over the intercom, "Sloop _Bendlerblock_, you are cleared for liftoff."

"Copy tower control; initiating launch sequence."

The pilot flipped a final switch and Damiano could feel a soft rumble throughout the ship; a muffled whine crescendoed as the engines ignited. There was a slight shake and then, through the viewport, Damiano could see the platform beginning to drop out from beneath them as they lifted off. After a few moments of gradual ascent, the ship began to accelerate forward and upwards as the pilot guided them towards the sky.

Below, the cityscape began to fall away and was quickly shrouded from view as they glided into the gray clouds above. For a few moments, Damiano could see nothing except clouds from the cockpit. But then, in an instant, they broke through.

Above them was an endless blue expanse...growing darker...becoming black...and then...stars. Point after point of light began poking through the inky darkness until the entire field was ablaze.

It was beautiful.

He turned and looked down and could see the clouds falling away. The horizon became a curve and gradually collapsed into a sphere - a planet appeared below them with clouds and mountains and blue seas. They were now in open space.

"Come with me" spoke Dr. Belloc from behind Damiano and led him back into the lounge and up a spiral staircase in the corner to an observation deck in the upper hull of the spaceship. A sprawling starscape unfolded above them as they gazed up through the glass.

"It has taken a long time and a great deal of human effort to bring us here," said Belloc, with his eyes fixed on the expanse above them. "This company has stood for decades as major contributing factor to peace in this world; our mandate has been one of service." A proud tone colored his words.

"Everything from human organization to military strategy to fiscal policy falls into our operational scope. Negotiations, succession arbitration, combat operations, and more. Corporations, nations, and even religious institutions form our client base and yet we could grow much further."

"What's stopping you?" asked Damien after a moment.

For the first time since he began speaking, Dr. Belloc dropped his eyes from the starscape and looked off into the corner of the observatory. "People who don't want to be helped" he sighed; the very notion seemed to trouble his mood "and who are unwilling to do what is necessary to grow."

"Our sole purpose as part of ITAM is to help people to build a better world for themselves and their future generations yet so many choose to actively work against us and against their fellow man."

He turned and looked Damiano in the eye.

"So many simply choose to abandon their gift of reason, to merely exist with no true desire to answer the call of humanity. We must press on with any advantage that we may have against these...ideologies, if they can even be classified as such; it is our duty not only to ITAM but to the world. We must be the necessary structure in this world because we must do what must be done" he said, turning his gaze upon the starfield once again.

Damiano stood in thought. More and Belloc were both part of what seemed to be a great cause. It must be wonderful to have such drive, such a mission. Knowing something so certainly about yourself and to know that something to be good.

"I want to help you.".

Without turning the doctor responded, "You certainly will. You are our greatest hope."

Before Damiano could ask what he meant, Arthur appeared from the stairway.

"Excuse me, sirs, but we are making our pass-by of the Earth's moon."

Through the viewport, they could see the gray-white sphere make its way into their field of vision, its pale face pockmarked with craters from cosmic impacts in eons past. The scarred face was tranquil as they slide past in their spaceship.

There were several visible structures on the surface, connected together forming complex spidering patterns across the lunar soil. Various ports and even green domes housing vegetation could be observed from their distance.

"That is ITAM's lunar base," said Belloc pointing to one cluster of constructs. "Originally, it was used to evaluate the possibility of terraforming the entire Moon but it is currently being used primarily as a staging location." He then pointed at a large space station in orbit around the Moon. "It hosts several waypoint stations like that one and helps to launch and coordinate larger projects. Other organizations and governments are using the Moon in a similar fashion for various undertakings."

As the moon drifted off behind them, Arthur spoke up, "In a few moments we will begin our initial approach to our destination."

"What is our destination?" asked Damiano.

"_Pangea_" responded Arthur in a chipper tone.

Belloc gestured for Damien to follow Arthur who led them forward to the cockpit. Before them in the star-studded expanse was a shell-like object. It looked as if it were a third of an empty sphere, like the empty half of a cracked egg.

As they drew closer, Damien could see that it was a massive man-made structure suspended in space - he guessed it was nearly twice as big as the moon they had passed should it have been a full sphere. Along the inside of the shell, he could see huge and exposed dark tectonic plates slowing moving on a lava-like substance held in place by a faintly visible blue field. It was like peering inside of a globe of a planet layer by layer from the inside out.

The outer surface was an expansive terraformed landscape. Mountains, oceans, deserts, forests...all manner of biomes were visible upon the surface from their vantage point. Yet many large sections appeared to be incomplete with enormous metal frames appearing abruptly where the natural land ended.

"_Pangea_ is the single largest physical construction project ever undertaken by ITAM or by any other human organization to-date," interjected Arthur.

"The construction project began shortly after the signing of the New London accords which recognized ITAM internationally as a "landless nation" and granted it the rights and privileges thereof. As a side note: this action set a precedent for many other Earth organizations and as humanity continued to grow in numbers - there are now over 50 recognized "major" landless nations and several hundred "minor" variations. Space exploration and development have also grown rapidly in recent centuries with hundreds of constructs, colonies, and expeditions of varying sizes underway, many led by these new entities."

"Development was able to be conducted in a rapid manner employing a technique known as "exponential assembly" which is the process by which every piece of the design is built to include assets and materials that are allocated to build the next step. Rather than having to build each piece and then assemble them together, the segments would, to a great extent, build each other which proved to be immensely beneficial in the larger sections such as the construct's spaceframe."

"While there are many other major projects, _Pangea_ is by far the largest in physical dimensions."

Soon they began their descent into the atmosphere with more features becoming increasingly clear. Cities were scattered about the surface but were few and far between; other space and airships could be seen flitting about the airspace.

"That ahead is the city of Hua," said Arthur pointing beyond the viewport.

The city's buildings and towers were sleek but simple; it's layout and design indicated one of a well-developed metropolis while still maintaining a feeling of rugged pioneering. As they coasted over the cityscape, lush trees and well-kept parks and streets opened up and figures and vehicles were visible moving about beneath them. The ship began to descend towards a landing pad in the middle of the city.

"Come" instructed Dr. Belloc and they moved back into the entrance foyer as the other passengers began to congregate there.

More came out of a side hallway and smiled at Damiano as she took a place standing next to him. After a few minutes, there was a soft bump as the landing gear hit the ground and the engines gave off a muffled whine as they powered down. The hatch slowly dropped open and the landing board extended down to the platform. Damien followed Belloc and More out of the ship and into the warm sunlight.

Awaiting them on the platform was a single man and while the majority of the retinue dispersed Belloc and More strode over to meet him.

His dark clothes stood out from the landing port backdrop in a stark way. He carried himself very upright and a steady gaze rested upon the approaching party; he emanated authority.

"Mr. Lewis," said Ms. More as she extended her hand towards the man "it is good to see you again."

He briefly shook her hand.

"Thank you, Alex."

She paused, a little surprised at his brusqueness of his tone, before stepping back. Belloc nodded in greeting but Lewis barely registered the acknowledgment. There was a tension between the two of them and Lewis.

"We were not expecting a reception," said More with a smile, apparently trying to cajole a more genial mood out of Lewis. "Hopefully we didn't keep you waiting."

"Not at all" replied Lewis evenly.

"Well, I'm glad to hear it! Even if it is a wonderful day to be caught outside."

"Quite. Where is our guest?"

More shifted, nearly imperceptibly to place her body between Lewis and himself.

"He is still very new to the world-"

"I understand that" interjected Lewis, cutting her off mid-sentence. "But we are here for him, and him alone."

With a look over at Belloc, she reluctantly turned and motioned for Damiano to step forward.

"This is Damien."

Lewis turned his gaze towards Damiano who continued to eye him warily. He beckoned him to come closer.

As he began to approach Lewis took a swift step forward placing them nearly face-to-face. Lewis looked intently into Damien's eyes without saying a word. Damien defiantly stared back.

After a few tense moments, Lewis spoke.

"Very well then," he said, without breaking eye contact, "let's begin the tour."
