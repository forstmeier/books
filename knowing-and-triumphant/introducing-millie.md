"Creating new avenues for human ingenuity is arguably the most important service we seek to provide," said Lewis as he led them through the building. They came to a large vaulted room with a round table-sized computer terminal in the middle.

Hovering above it were large holograms of schematics and charts that several technicians manning the console were discussing. Lewis waved them from the room and tapped several commands into the terminal. The charts were replaced with a small sphere that scattered into swirling fragments before coalescing into the form of a woman.

She was about a third the scale of a human and floated above the table looking about at the group which now only consisted of Lewis, More, Belloc, Arthur, and Damiano. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun and her eyes were a distinctly sparkling blue even in her blue holographic form. She brushed a wayward strand of hair from here face.

"Identify yourself and your make" ordered Lewis.

"My designation is RT-03. I am a _Consul_-Class Artificial Intelligence" responded the hologram.

"She is one of many variations of artificial intelligence units that we employ" continued Lewis. "They range from "weak" AI, which have powerful creative and operational capacities but are bound by the scope of their duties, to "strong" programs which have a general intelligence and application as well as truer experiences of self-direction and personal evolution. She is of the latter."
