His helmet snapped into place and he leaped at Peter.

A great sword materialized in his hand. Silver metal and glowing orange hard light, faint "embers" could be seen whisping away from it as it cut through the air.

"SWORD!" shouted Millie in Peter's ear.

As if by sheer will, one materialized in Peter's suddenly outstretched hand. It was like he had "called" it from somewhere, composing it from a digital design into physical form with infinitesimal pieces of surrounding matter pulled in as raw material for its assembly. Millie was helping him focus and unearth his abilities; Peter could feel her guidance as he raised his blade to parry Belloc's heavy downward slash. Breaking the lock, their blades began flying as they moved along the rounded surface of the Mover's armor.

Belloc's Mover had again closed the gap with Peter's and the two robots, set in their autopilot mode, began clumsily wrestling again. Peter's Mover landed a massive blow that jolted the ground beneath the duelists' feet throwing them off balance briefly.

Peter regained his footing first and quickly jumped forward, propelling himself with a blast from his boosters. He swung his blade down but Belloc managed to block the blow, their blades locked together again. Peter's armor helped provide him with the strength to push back against Belloc.

Belloc's helmet whipped open revealing his face twisted from exertion.

"You don't want to do this" he grunted through his teeth, "You don't want to have to fight, to have to kill me."

"No, but I will" and breaking their clash, he spun away as Belloc stepped forward, slashing his blade through the air Peter had been a second before.

"That's easier said than done, Peter."

His sword blade ignited into twisting flames and cinders cascaded from it in the wind. With one hand, he battered at Peter's defenses.

"Ending my life would be the easy part but you have to live with what's left of yourself afterward."

He pivoted inwards, suddenly close to Peter and punched him in the face with his gauntleted hand. Peter stumbled backward trying to deflect the onslaught; he was losing ground.

About them, the Mover's were locked in a grapple and Peter quickly jumped away along the titan's outstretched arm. Belloc followed close behind.

Pivoting, Peter turned and cast a swift lighting blast back at Belloc. Belloc's gauntleted hand shot forward, catching the incoming torrent and bracing himself, he pushed back creating a looping energy stream between them.

The connection broke away as the duelists dove out of the way as Peter's bot chopped down on the Belloc Mover's arm. Peter tried to dive past his opponent back onto the shoulder plate but Belloc's blade connected.

He stumbled away caught off balance falling to his knees. His systems indicated that his booster system was nearly completely disabled. There were no more than a handful of small horizontal bursts left if that.

"We're stuck here," said Millie grimly.
