Peter stood, stunned, staring at the now motionless Simon fixed to his wall.

Lewis grabbed his arm and pulled him back into the antechamber. Four robots were there standing to attention in a square formation - their tall, slim bodies were covered in combat armor and in their hands were various weapons. They were apparently some sort of escort.

The door into the outer room was shut and appeared to have an additional security door in place sealing the way in. A muffled banging could be heard from the other side and Peter's heart leaped into his mouth when he made out More's voice attempting to shout through the barricade.

Without acknowledging the stifled commotion, Lewis guided Peter through a door, previously concealed, off to the side of the room which led to a long, dimly lit and unfinished hallway. Lewis's rapid pace increased to a steady jog forcing Peter to begin running to keep up.

His heart was beating through his throat, his stomach was lurching about in a jumbled mess. Where Lewis was leading them was a mystery as were his plans for Peter. The pistol was still gripped in his hand. They hurried down the corridor.
