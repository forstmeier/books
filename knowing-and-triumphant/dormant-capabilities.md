Peter didn't need him to say the name. Of course, he already knew who it was. The puppet master behind every curtain. He shook his head as if to clear it and followed Arthur's directions to begin donning the suit.

"What are my dormant capabilities?" he asked, changing the subject.

Arthur continued strapping plates and pieces into place as he answered. "The Proctor is endowed with substantial powers the greatest of which is the capacity to instantaneously interface with the entire ITAM & Co. network. This access conveys the authority to dictate orders to and directly control ITAM personnel and equipment."

"The direct link to the computational system also allows for an expanded mental capacity and processing ability by offloading operations into the network - a balance which will take time to hone. Additionally, this access provides for the augmentation of tools and weaponry linked to the network with no currently known upper boundary."

Peter looked down at the mostly assembled suit of armor he was wearing. It consisted of several plated segments primarily covering the torso and shoulders with plates protecting the limbs. The armored boot legs had some pipe-like equipment for an unknown purpose attached to them, as did his gauntlets and back.

"Again" spoke Arthur, "this is a defensive measure for use only in the event of an emergency. There is no need to be concerned."

"Too late", Peter muttered to himself.

"Are you ready, sir?"

Peter nodded in affirmation.
