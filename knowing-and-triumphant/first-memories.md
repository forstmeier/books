Damien sat in the locker room by himself quietly taking in his surroundings. Just several hours earlier he had awoken in a dim gray-blue laboratory, which was faintly illuminated by a storm outside, suspended in a large, clear, liquid-filled container.  

Several individuals were in the laboratory and one had introduced himself as Dr. Belloc, the lead physician and partner on his case, and assured him that he was safe. He remembered the doctor's steely gaze projecting a singularly intense focus as he informed Damien of his name and that his project designation was SH-335C - a meaningless and confusing piece of information to the young boy.  

After being released from the container, and after a battery of tests and examinations, he was led to the locker room he presently found himself in. Recessed lights provided a nicely cozy feeling. Several shelves were stacked high with crisp, white towels and robes.  

His first memories.
