Peter woke to Arthur gently shaking him in his bunk. He could smell breakfast being prepared outside and after getting dressed he joined Lewis who was already eating. They ate in silence but Peter felt as though Lewis was more relaxed than he had been yesterday - as if some weight had been lifted off his shoulders.

As the two finished, Arthur suddenly stepped out of the lodge and walked to the edge of the encampment staring off towards the horizon.

"Sir, they are here."

Peter stood, Lewis remained seated.

At first, nothing could be seen, but tiny shapes quickly materialized and they swiftly coalesced into skiffs filled with figures. They descended on their position quickly and Peter could see More and Belloc among their complements.

On touchdown, armed security forces and robots jumped off and surrounded the campsite with drawn, but not brandished, weapons. Belloc leaped down with them and stood gazing intently on the fugitives; More remained standing on the ship.

"Mr. Lewis" she called down, "good to see you. It was difficult getting in touch given the communications blackout we were experiencing until just this morning. Just such an inconvenient coincidence."

"Thank you for your perseverance" responded Lewis. "Attributes like that are surely why you were selected for your role in ITAM. I remember voting to extend the you the offer quite well."

More pursed her lips in frustration.

"Would you be so kind as to allow us to escort you back? The facility is prepared for the next stage." her voice gaining a commanding edge - clearly this question only had one answer. Despite the violent nature of their escape and while Lewis wasn't necessarily excited to see More and Belloc, he seemed legitimately open to accepting the CEO's offer.

"Absolutely," said Lewis, smiling back at More. He turned to Peter, "Ms. More is absolutely correct. It is time for the next stage of your development." Something in Lewis's voice seemed to indicate a sense of acceptance, or even comfort, with the whole situation..

A ramp lowered from More's skiff and Lewis stepped on board followed by Peter and Arthur who had quickly gathered their things from the camp.

"Are you alright, Damien?" asked More placing her hand on his shoulder.

"Yes, I'm fine" he responded. "And my name is Peter now."

She blinked in surprise, "Oh, okay, Peter" she said with a worried smile. "I'm glad you're back with us."

Squeezing his shoulder reassuringly, she assumed a position beside him, adopting a protective stance. Nothing would be taking him away from her again.

On the other hand, Lewis was the picture of calm. He reclined in the bow seating, as if he hadn't a care in the world, looking out over the speeding terrain below.
