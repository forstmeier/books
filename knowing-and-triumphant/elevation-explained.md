Peter shook his head as if to clear his thoughts and quickly changed the subject. "What does my elevation entail?"

More and Belloc exchanged looks.

"A medical operation, Peter," said More slowly. "It will be painful and carries great risk despite our exceptional technological and medical capabilities."

"You were created physiologically and genetically human although some aspects have been improved to allow for a more durable vessel with which to carry out your role as the building block for our future. Some examples of this include stronger bones and muscle fibers as well as greatly improved reflexes and mental acuity. These are just scraping the surface and many of these latent abilities have yet to be activated."

Belloc gestured at the floating readouts above them.

"A great deal of planning has been put into this. The process will entail a series of injections into areas such as the base of the skull, the forearms, and lower spine. Additionally, there will be some minor invasive surgery on your hands, arms, and legs."

"The result of this process will be an activation of your dormant connection to the ITAM network as well as abilities such as particle manipulation which I will expand upon later."

More interjected, "But Peter, remember, this operation does have risk. Your body could reject the implants and lead to fatal complications. Submitting to this procedure would be your _final_ acceptance and ascension to the role of Proctor."

She was worriedly looking at him, again like a mother or older sister looking out for his best interests, despite him being a major player in forwarding her and Belloc's agendas.
