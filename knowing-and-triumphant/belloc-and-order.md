There was a brief pause.

"What...did the two of you discuss, Peter?"

"He wanted to teach me my humanity, I suppose."

More gave him a puzzled look, "What do you mean?"

Peter responded slowly, as he wasn't certain how to phrase it himself.

"I'm not exactly sure but it seemed like he wanted me to understand responsibility and the responsibilities of my position. What it means to be Proctor."

Belloc gave a short, humorless laugh.

"Ah, "responsibility," that same "responsibility" with which he seized you."

More jumped in swiftly, "Responsibilities can be handled many ways. Some ways are good and others are bad."

"Lewis was providing his take coldly and regardless of the cost," Belloc followed up.

"He wants freedom and self-direction," said Peter.

"Yes, but this is costly."

"How so?"

"Because sometimes" cut in More yet again "the free choices of some cause loses for many others. Not all people are good and their actions can lead to injustices. Why not prevent them before they occur?"

"But why approach it like that?" asked Peter. "Why not hope for the best and plan for the worst?"

"By taking action ourselves we become proactive, instead of reactive, to evils as they arise," answered More.

Belloc added, "The very loss of control subverts the human presence in this world, a presence that is truly unique in the currently known universe. The capacity for self-awareness, understanding, and sentience is beyond all, other than our mechanical creations that we have willed into existence. That loss of control forfeits an endowed right of humanity."

"Even giving up control over fellow humans?" asked Peter.

"Yes" answered Belloc, "even then. Those who can provide guidance must do so. Asserting control and enforcing our will to bring order to chaos is part of our calling, both in terms of the natural world and for society as a whole - arguably the latter even more so. Freeing humanity from irrational behavior and moving us forward cohesively and beneficially is our greatest calling."

There was a brief silence as Peter absorbed this information.

"Peace is something that we can attain," said More. "Even today, hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people live in agony in our galaxy. Taking control could be a means to alleviate their suffering."

"Has anyone done good if they're forced to do so? Isn't it an empty action?"

"The point is that it gets the results needed" answered More, ignoring Peter's question. "Those with power should use it, otherwise they would be irresponsible and calloused as to the needs of others - they would bear the burden of their lack of action. Lifting the lowly is the responsibility of everyone, great and small, so why shouldn't those with power leverage their position to do so? Not doing so would be...wasteful."

Peter again absorbed this statement silently.

Turning to Belloc he asked, "And what happens to us when we do take up that power?"

Belloc returned a small, hard smile.

"Humanity will be improved," he said, his eyes distant. "We will grow and develop and become greater still than we ever were."
