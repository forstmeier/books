The full city was visible. It was in chaos.

Card had apparently brought a full military contingent with him when he arrived on _Pangea_ and it was in armed combat with More and Belloc's forces. He had been prepared for the worst which was now realized.

Open conflict stretched across the Scholl cityscape. Smoke was rising from various blocks and there were explosions and laser blasts throughout the streets. Above them, ships and gunboats were suspended in air trading fire. Even further up still, in the high reaches of the atmosphere, small capital ships were visible engaging one another.

More and Belloc clearly had greater influence and support than Peter had seen and were entirely capable of taking on Card's forces. It was a civil war within ITAM & Co. Conducted on the surface of its greatest physical creation. Humanity could never escape its scars because it was always the one to inflict them.

The pair ducked and dodged among the buildings as their pursuers, who had finally lifted off from the square, fell into chase behind them. Five flying robots now pursued the two escapees. Peter couldn't see what had happened to Lewis but he had proven himself a supreme strategist at the very least.

"I am to bring you to the _Arbiter_," shouted Arthur. "Your installation is to take place at any cost."

They veered sharply to the side as two dueling gunboats dropped through the air in front of them.

Following Arthur's lead, they cut out across the burning city, which felt a great deal like a smaller version of Hua and zipped out over the landscape beyond the outer limits. Their robot pursuers followed them doggedly.

Keeping low to the ground, the pursued cut in and out of what little cover that could be found in the grassland.
