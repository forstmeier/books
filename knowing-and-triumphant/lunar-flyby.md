"I want to help you.".

Without turning the doctor responded, "You certainly will. You are our greatest hope."

Before Damiano could ask what he meant, Arthur appeared from the stairway.

"Excuse me, sirs, but we are making our pass-by of the Earth's moon."

Through the viewport, they could see the gray-white sphere make its way into their field of vision, its pale face pockmarked with craters from cosmic impacts in eons past. The scarred face was tranquil as they slide past in their spaceship.

There were several visible structures on the surface, connected together forming complex spidering patterns across the lunar soil. Various ports and even green domes housing vegetation could be observed from their distance.

"That is ITAM's lunar base," said Belloc pointing to one cluster of constructs. "Originally, it was used to evaluate the possibility of terraforming the entire Moon but it is currently being used primarily as a staging location." He then pointed at a large space station in orbit around the Moon. "It hosts several waypoint stations like that one and helps to launch and coordinate larger projects. We provide infrastructure to organizations and governments for various undertakings."
