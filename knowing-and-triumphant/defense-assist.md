Peter ripped his eyes away from the skirmish going on behind him and turned back to the viewer just in time to divert another blow from Belloc.

Another blow, another block, another blow, another glancing hit. The struggle continued between the two titans but Belloc was gaining the upper hand on Peter. His attacks were more ferocious and he was willing to open himself up to counter blows to deliver devastating strikes. Belloc knew Peter was fighting on two fronts and could not maintain control in the cabin for long.

He felt another presence aboard the Mover and a hologram popped up showing another wave of robots converging on the control room. There were too many for Arthur to hold off on his own.

But at this point, their course was set.

With that, he set the onboard artificial intelligence to control the titan and directed it to move away from Belloc. It would be able to conduct some basic defense but it would be no long-term match for Belloc.

Peter disconnected from the platform and jumping down he ran to support Arthur. The invaders began flanking the adjunct who was still engaged in dogged combat, and began breaking towards Peter. As he sprinted towards the oncoming robots, his feet lit the floor patterns with every step, like ripples from a stone falling into a pool.

Just as the two sides closed the gap, Peter dropped to a knee and slammed a punch into the floor. A blue forcefield surged from the ground and rushed outward in a wave of energy that briefly stunned the attackers nearest to Peter. Without pausing, Peter raised his other hand and fired a quick torrent of miniature rockets from his wrist, blowing them to shattered husks.

Another, that had been out of the blast radius, turned towards Peter. Its stature was oddly upright and not in a combat posture like the others had been in. It twitched and then ran towards him.
