He was now aware of the Mover's situation. Bringing it to a halt, he began gradually turning the behemoth to face its pursuer. It was still a long way off but the distance would close quickly given their relative scale.

Out of the corner of his eye, Peter noticed something - among the array of holograms surrounding him, he could see several indicating approaching vessels. He turned his head to regard them - the Mover's head turned in tandem. A handful of airships was closing in on them and he could see squads of flying robots disembarking. They were the vanguard. The robots zipped towards Peter's Mover; he had no means of stopping them and their boarding was both imminent and inevitable.

Peter turned and looked at Arthur who was observing the scene.

"They are coming," said Peter.

Arthur nodded.

"Millie." She materialized next to Peter. "Go with Arthur."

"Right," she responded before bounding down Peter's arm, jumping into the air between him and Arthur and disappearing. Arthur twitched his head.

"We're ready," spoke both Arthur and Millie's voices from the robot's mouth.

A hologram appeared before Peter showing the vanguard had blasted through the sealed hatch and were entering into the Mover's body.

"I will do what I can to hold them off, sir," said Arthur and turned back towards the hallway that they had entered a few minutes prior, the only point of entry.
