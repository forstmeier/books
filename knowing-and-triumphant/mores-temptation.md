Arthur, who had incapacitated the remainder of the wave, quickly took in the situation and, decapitating his last opponent who he had been holding in a headlock, launching towards them. The oncoming attacker noticed Arthur from the corner of its vision and pivoted to face him.

But Arthur was too fast.

In the blink of an eye, Arthur delivered a quick series of blows and then went in for the grapple. A kick shattered the robot's knee and with a twist, Arthur wrapped up both the opponent's hands and with his other hand clamped around its throat he forced it into a kneeling position before him.

Just then, a voice came from the robot, a voice Peter instantly recognized.

"Peter."

It was More. Peter froze.

"It's me, Alex."

Peter couldn't move. More must be remotely possessing the robot but it felt like she was there with him in the Mover.

"Come back to us, to me. We're here for you."

Peter couldn't speak.

"This can all be over if you choose it to be so."

Her voice was full of longing. Peter unknowingly took a step towards the avatar.

"We love you, Peter."

He halted, stunned. He'd never heard those words before. Someone, in this world, attesting to a genuine care for his well being, for him. More genuinely felt that way. She cared about him.

Before anything else could happen, Arthur looked back towards the viewscreen - Peter followed his gaze. The opposing Mover was quickly closing the distance Peter had temporarily put between them.

Just then, two more robot soldiers entered the room in a sprint from the hallway. Nothing was stopping them from freely entering the Mover.

Arthur shoved the restrained robot down and away, jumping and twisting to avoid the laser fire from the intruders across the room. Before the avatar could catch its balance, Arthur squeezed off a single mid-air shot which passed cleanly through its temple. The robot slumped to the ground. Arthur fired off several shots into the two attackers quickly damaging them before finishing them off with similarly precise headshots.

Millie appeared over Arthur's shoulder.

"I'm sorry," she said quickly, "but that was necessary. She was just stalling for time even if she does care."
