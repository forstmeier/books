Peter's heart jumped with surprise. Despite their prior talks, Simon's indication of succession, and Lewis's abduction, this was a new twist. The thought of being a leader was daunting enough; his stomach was still in knots over it. Being the next stage in an entire species' evolution brought with it an unspeakable burden.

"I-I don't know-" he stammered nervously, "I'm just a boy, I'm human, like both of you. Simon said it himself."

"He wasn't wrong, Peter," said More. "Maybe he didn't tell you all of your purposes here."

"The Machine," said Belloc, Peter noted that he didn't address him at "Simon" - he hadn't even called him "Peter" this whole time, "is responsible for the organization as a whole and not directly involved with the advancement of humanity's biological form."

They walked down another dark hallway into a relatively small circular room who's ceiling rose high above them forming a large cylindrical room. The ceiling itself was obscured by blue and white lights and the walls contained numerous holographic readouts and terminals. Several of the biomechanical jellyfish floated about touching and manipulating various bits of the interface.

A series of holograms projected just over the heads were oriented so that those on the ground could read them. Displaying a variety of schematics and what appeared to be an order of operations for some medical procedure. A human body was clearly outlined and it slowly rotated to face the group. A pit opened in Peter's stomach as he looked into his own face. The eyes were closed but he recognized himself from the reflection he saw back in Bellefonte.

"You are the last stage of the first steps in our progress as humans" he heard More say through a dull ringing in his ears.

"To expand upon what I said before" continued Belloc, "ITAM is not just seeking to synthesize with technology to improve our physical nature. We seek to integrate with the world and universe, attaining an omnipotent presence."

"I believe that this is the truest of the true goals of ITAM and all other goals are subordinate to it. Humans are not merely recreating themselves or their environment; humans are not merely creating universal synergy. Humans are creating themselves into gods, achieving perfection."

More chimed in, "Both a bodily perfection and a conscious enlightenment. Attaining pure reason through this would lead to better people, a better world."

"We aren't gods" he heard himself say. "We can seek perfection without contradicting our place in the universe but we can never forget what we are. Human."

Everyone in the group looked at him in silent surprise.

It was as if the realization and speech hadn't been his own, yet he had seen it before himself so clearly. It was that feeling of learning a "truth" or an "absolute" and it feels so natural yet understanding it wasn't actually your own and existed in complete independence from the thinker.
