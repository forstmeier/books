> As you are no doubt already aware, an arrest order has been issued for the fugitive Lewis. Our immediate objective is to capture him and to safely recover the Proctor Hopeful and as the last two individuals to be with them, and as the most senior members on site, I am ordering you to lead the retrieval operation.

> Bring Lewis in alive.  
>  
> This committee had previously ascertained that there is potential abuse of the Proctor project taking place, beyond what we are currently witnessing, so I have taken the liberty to attach a copy of the arrest order to this email as a reminder that the goals and plans of ITAM must not be interrupted.
