Peter's helmet retracted from his face and down into his upper armor plates. Inside the Mover was cool and a steady rumble of machinery could be heard behind the hallway walls. These corridors were clearly more functional; exposed metal plates and pipes could be seen as the pair moved quickly deeper into the belly of the beast. After passing through several of these tunnels they came to a more "finished" section with sleek black floors and white walls.

They ran down the hall with Peter leading the way. He knew where to go - he could see the pathway in his head.

In short order, they reached an elevator which rose to the higher levels of the Mover and opened on a small, spherical antechamber connected to a somewhat wider hallway with a tall ceiling. Jogging down the hall, they came to a closed door at the far end. Peter opened it with a wave of his hand.

Before them was a large cavernous room.

Its dark floors were polished to a reflective sheen; inlaid etchings formed large circular patterns emanating from the center of the room. The dark gray walls were also polished and rose up in a tall dome. On the far side was a massive screen showing that the open expanse of the _Pangea_ grassland. Steady movement over the scenery indicated that this was the visual coming from the Mover's eyes.
