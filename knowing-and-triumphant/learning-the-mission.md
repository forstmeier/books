"But I'm still different, aren't I?"  

"The only true difference is that you were deliberately brought into this world, which if you think about it, really is the way many of us human-born individuals come about." She smiled reassuringly again; her look conveyed an authenticity to her statement.  

"Why don't I tell you a bit about what brought you here?" she said, changing the subject having satisfied herself with having soothed Damiano's concerns. Damien nodded. "We, ITAM, are a company that was founded centuries ago in this very city, Bellefonte, in this very building, the Old Match Factory. The goal of the undertaking was simple at its core: to bring order to society. To achieve this end, the company sought to optimize human ingenuity and enhance natural systems in the world."  

"Human history is marred by the bloodshed of war, perpetual pain, and innumerable self-inflicted injuries throughout the centuries. Our history as a species is a tragic and even evil one - our capacity for violence towards one another and our world is unparalleled in the universe. ITAM sought to throw off these chains and move humanity forward to its truest fulfillment by providing guidance against such acts."  

"Basically, we are building products that are "societal-facing" and that seek to solve our deepest issues to bring about meaningful change. It sounds like marketing-speak, but it's very true."  

"You'll soon find out you have been given many abilities-" More started, but Dr. Belloc took a quick step forward. More glanced over at Belloc before continuing in a measured manner, "...but...you are still early in your development. You are young and full of immense potential; potential to help us." Dr. Belloc stepped back and resumed his neutral stance but his eyes were fixed on Ms. More's face looking ready to pounce on her very words. His face was calm.  

Leaning forward, More looked intently into Damiano's eyes from across the table, "Will you help us in our mission?" Both More and Dr. Belloc were now fixated on Damien, waiting for his response.
