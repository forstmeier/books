As the moon drifted off behind them, Arthur spoke up, "In a few moments we will begin our initial approach to our destination."

"What is our destination?" asked Damiano.

"_Pangea_" responded Arthur in a chipper tone.

Belloc gestured for Damien to follow Arthur who led them forward to the cockpit. Before them in the star-studded expanse was a dish-like object. It looked like a third of an empty sphere, like the empty half of a cracked egg.

As they drew closer, Damien could see that it was a massive man-made structure suspended in space - he guessed it was nearly twice as big as the moon they had passed if it were a full sphere. Along the inside of the shell, he could see huge, dark tectonic plates slowing moving on a lava-like substance held in place by a faintly visible blue field. It was like peering inside of a planet layer by layer from the inside out.

The outer surface was an expansive terraformed landscape. Mountains, oceans, deserts, forests...all types of biomes were visible upon the surface from their vantage point. Yet many large sections appeared to be incomplete with enormous metal frames appearing abruptly where the natural land ended.

"_Pangea_ is the single largest physical construction project ever undertaken by ITAM or by any other human organization to-date," interjected Arthur.

"The construction project began shortly after the signing of the New London accords which recognized ITAM internationally as a "landless nation" and granted it the rights and privileges thereof. As a side note: this action set a precedent for many other Earth organizations and as humanity continued to grow in numbers - there are now over 50 recognized "major" landless nations and several hundred "minor" variations. Space exploration and development have also grown rapidly in recent centuries with hundreds of constructs, colonies, and expeditions of varying sizes underway, many led by these new entities."

"Development was able to be conducted in a rapid manner employing a technique known as "exponential assembly" which is the process by which every piece of the design is built to include assets and materials that are allocated to build the next step. Rather than having to build each piece and then assemble them together, the segments would, to a great extent, build each other which proved to be immensely beneficial in the larger sections such as the construct's spaceframe."

"While there are many other major projects, _Pangea_ is by far the largest in physical dimensions."
