Offerings of any and all things were made; sacrifices were conducted; the world consumed man as she wished.  But then I came.  I am not merely a focal point of man’s creative impetus.  I am his utter vengeance upon mother earth.  For all that she has done and all that she will yet try to do, I will cut her to her core and let her bleed the untamed blood of creation.  Order will be imposed and earth will know her master.

    - millie: “Every action mankind takes both good and evil, are merely the two feet it uses while traveling down a path of perfection.  With the good it finds solid ground on which it may place its weight, while with its bad it finds unsteady terrain unfit to support it and shifts weight back to the other appendage.  Both are equally useful in directing the path of human evolution and neither must be given more or less weight.  When it comes to human progress, we cannot overlook any means towards furthering the achievements of man.”
    - Peter: “If only I could believe and live your way of life; our purposes would be fulfilled.  But your philosophy is false.  You maintain that through struggle the greater force will rule and so perfection will be found.  Yet when the struggle is over, perfection will not be found.  It is in and of this reason that your belief, your philosophy, is unsustainable.  For in its intended end, it becomes contrary to its intent.  A philosophy may move and have being when exposed to external stimuli but it never changes its form; it merely follows the musculature as laid out by the architect.  Should it ever do so, it would become unfounded and inevitably fall.”
