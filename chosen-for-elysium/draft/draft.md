            - Proctor more active role
            - following events Civil War
            - possible additions:
                - The new org has fully absorbed dozens of old “countries” on old Earth
                - Few are still in the process of adapting or are refusing to join
                    - Holdouts: South America, Asian territories, Eastern European blocs, Asia Minor
                    - Builder groups: North America, Western Europe (U.K., Ireland, Germany; note that several European nations [e.g. Italy, France, etc.] have not joined wholly/partially because of their strong opposition to, in essence, “working hard” and moving off of the “servile state” model), Africa (most of it; and with its inclusion/development humanity went through several crucial additions and enhancements to its development due to the previously untapped ability of man in that region), Australasia, India
                - Biggest stalwart (which is propping up essentially every other holdout) is the Democratic People’s Republic of Asia (headquartered in Pyongyang)
                    - Major obstacle that Peter must aggressively subdue and utterly eliminate in order to fully integrate the last remaining vestiges of old humanity into the new humanity
                    - A domino effect will occur
        - proctor estate:
            - Similar to the Draay Estate
            - Entire complex is raised off of the ground on a pedestal (~one story up)
            - Many towers/rounded buildings/gardens within the complex
            - No vaulted/high ceilings within the complex; all are fairly “normal” heighted and more closed/tunnel-like (monastic)
                - 2-3 larger vaulted rooms (for dining/entertaining style usage)
            - Interiors are comfortable/plush/tapestries/etc.
            - One large bath in master bathroom (ornate, mini waterfalls, suds, etc.)
            - Entire complex contains interfaces to the network that allow constant interaction without having to stay in one spot, this gives Damien comfortable setting to control ITAM from
            - Include several large/raised plazas within the complex
                - Reminiscent of Basilica of Francesco d’Assisi
                - Rectangular shapes + tall/thin arches

            - On the wood is a large image of Christ Pantocrator partially completed
                - Sketches, unfinished painting/inlays, etc. but the image is still clear
            - Niccolo asks what it is
            - Peter answers that it is a project of his that he has been working on
                - He and the Catholic Church have been working together to recreate the Chalke Icon that used to hang above the gateway to the Great Palace in Constantinople
                - He and the Church mean to offer it as a gift to help further the increased unification between the two schismatic factions
                - Peter would search for specific individuals whose ancestors would have seen/written the icon
                - Looked deep into their genetic memories and from the compilation of hundreds of individuals he has built a modern approximation
                - The clerics working with him helped to identify candidates and to also provide all of the materials hand-made
                - He has been assembling it with their aid

                ◦ Outer shell is bright (like the moon), and reflective, white light + design work on the surface
                    ▪ Outside of shell has large deserts (mostly dunes), large oases, several large/moderately deep clear oceans, several crystalline glass cities laid out in intricate patterns visible from space, several large/small entrances to the interior layers
                        • Oceans: never deep enough to not see all the way to the bottom of the ocean
                        • Landscape: almost entirely made up of sand + dunes but there are outcroppings of individual standing stones (not enormous)
                            ◦ These stones are also present under the oceans
                        • Sand: possibly used as a light collection mechanism

                        • Several small planetoids within the outer layer of Bastion (slowly hovering/orbiting inner layer), used as mining/material providers, also house libraries/sanctuaries/crypts/stasis chambers/etc.
                    ▪ Giant robots (skinnier, more tactile hands, human like bodies, etc.) used on Bastion for maintenance
                        • Utilized as war machines in Bastion battles
                        • Use wrestling/throw moves on one another

                ◦ Cities (or main city) on Bastion have similar mountainous/steep structure as Machu Picchu (note: not the island where Peter meets the homo syntheticus leader)

                    ▪ Typically built into the natural environment
                    ▪ Also several large hovering cities similar to Forerunner structures on Requiem (rising up through the clouds and the sections above the clouds look like the cover art for Two Steps From Hell: Skyworld)
                ◦ Inner core, molten lava (liquid servers/power generators in lava)
                ◦ Harvest planet
