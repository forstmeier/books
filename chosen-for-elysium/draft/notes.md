note: (use in discussion)
- personal lives so individually driven 
- discussion entirely collapsed 
- no potential for discussion 
- as only truth is self-determined 
- meant there is no option for discussion 
- alternatives ironically religions 
- catholic/orthodox in particular 
- discussions on theology/truth 
- core to their being w/ fathers/doctors

battle music:
- The music should be a humongous meld of orchestral and military drumming/piping. Think along the lines of Minstrel Boy meets Ode to Joy meets Vita Nostra. It would be designed to provide a common theme/backbone to the operation as well as a rhythm and choreography available only in music.

ministries: (possibly use in chapter intro)
- Ministry of War - Charged with defending the Builders and all of their creation : War & defense : Military development : Weapons armaments
- Ministry of the Proctor - Charged with overseeing the Builders and coordinating their progress : Program coordination : Master planning : Financial organization : Internal coordination
- Ministry of Man - Charged with furthering the development and evolution of Man : Human development : Theological succession : Personel management
- Ministry of Material - Charged with providing for the continuation of the Builders and their projects : Supply management : Material acquisition
- Ministry of Constructs - Charged with erecting the new domicle of Man and the structures of the Builders : Planetary constructs : Infrastructure development : Metropolitian development
- Ministry of Applications - Charged with creating the means of furthering the growth of Man : Technological projects
- Ministry of the Foundation - Charged with imbuing the existence of Man into perpetuity : Expansion colonization : External integration

note: (use in discussion or intro)
- Man is perpetually attempting to change his environment 
- Even those individuals secluding themselves from society and becoming ascetics are changing their environment 
- Inventors and murderers change their environments 
- Everyone moves on their own impetus to build for themselves what they themselves see 
- This vision can be either singular or collective 
- Man is the creative beast 

note: 
- Draw on own personal development / feelings to present Peter's transformation throughout the trilogy

notes:
- Peter’s position as viewed by earth religions:
    - Catholicism: recognized as a man with a specific worldly purpose, keenly observes to see if he falls within acceptable dogmatic precedents, utilizes services as a mediator with Orthodoxy
    - Orthodoxy: recognized as a man with a specific worldly purpose, keenly observes to see if he falls within acceptable dogmatic precedents, utilizes services as a mediator with Catholicism
    - Coptic/Middle-Eastern Churches: similar views as Catholicism/Orthodoxy, extensively relied upon one another during the reconstruction after the Second Civil War, uses services in creating communion with Catholicism   
    - Judaism: generally recognized as a man with a specific worldly purpose, some rabbinic denominations maintain that he is creating the Third Temple (but is not the messiah)
    - Buddhism: he has attained the buddhatva as and is considered an enlightened one/Buddha by them, considered holy and many faithful Buddhists adhere to his commandments adamantly
    - Proctorism: considered to be a demi-god/deity, incarnate version of perfection and the guide to perfect constructs, religion created out of his actions/writings
    - Islam: potentially a guide through the personal jihad, an official Ummah is forming on Earth
        - Wishing to utilize Peter to re-establish the great Ummah laid out by Muhammad’s Constitution of Medina
        - Being rewritten as a Constitution of Antioch upon similar basis but with more modern components

notes: (dialogue)
- Ancient man, as he looked out upon the raw earth of yesterday, stared about in awe and fear.  He was at the utter mercy of the world and he pleaded to mother earth for survival.  Offerings of any and all things were made; sacrifices were conducted; the world consumed man as she wished.  But then I came.  I am not merely a focal point of man’s creative impetus.  I am his utter vengeance upon mother earth.  For all that she has done and all that she will yet try to do, I will cut her to her core and let her bleed the untamed blood of creation.  Order will be imposed and earth will know her master.

notes:
- Title: Iconist Prophecy
- Two people come: the Iconodule/Iconoclast
- One to create, one to destroy
- The debate is over which is which in order to side with one and combat the other (Karina v Peter debates)
    - Eventually Restraint (incorrectly) assumes that Karina is the Iconodule and Peter is the Iconoclast leading to the Bastion War
        - As Bastion is destroyed in the war, Peter was actually the Iconodule and Karina was the Iconoclast
        - Should that been Restraint’s choice it would have happened
            - E.g. if Peter is selected as the Iconodule he would protect/save Bastion from Karina
            - E.g. if Peter is selected as the Iconoclast (which he is) he seeks to destroy/defeat Bastion
        - It is a self-fulfilling prophecy
            - Prophecy creates an action and either choice would result in the same outcome/actions
- Describes Icon and its purpose
    - Acheiropoeta, icons not made by hand
        - Name of the capital city (Machu Pichu)
    - Caelestis, “of heaven”

notes: (discussion)
- Karina: “Every action mankind takes both good and evil, are merely the two feet it uses while traveling down a path of perfection.  With the good it finds solid ground on which it may place its weight, while with its bad it finds unsteady terrain unfit to support it and shifts weight back to the other appendage.  Both are equally useful in directing the path of human evolution and neither must be given more or less weight.  When it comes to human progress, we cannot overlook any means towards furthering the achievements of man.”

notes: (scene)
- Homo syntheticus mastered the bridge between data/physical existence and transference between the two
    - Blue stasis field, vertically moving light blue wisps/data streams
    - Dark/shadowy figure, slightly akimbo, standing amid light wisps
    - Once activated/released, data becomes more frantic in movements
    - Figure begins to move around
    - As exits the data stream, dark shadows transform into faint blue light data flows
    - All coalesce and form bones/muscles/implants
    - Form into a full homo syntheticus
    - Monasteries like Meteora, Greece + Mount Athos + etc.
        - Functioning communities and monasteries (some either/or)
        - Catholic monks on Bastion, either homo syntheticus or very human homo syntheticus
        - Aesthetics group:
            - Radical group within the Bastion forces
            - Biologically altered
            - Effectively underwent a chemotherapy-style alteration
                - Very long/intensive and mostly injection-based
            - Results in emaciated appearances/balding heads/ slender builds
            - Alterations create a biological bomb built into their DNA
                - Detonating/shaping the blast is determined by the detonating individual
            - Dress is loose fitting clothing/simple fabrics & clothes
            - Always smiling & never talking
            - Smooth/calm motions and hand gestures
            - Purpose (?)
- Peter + Karina decide to participate
    - Peter for the digital
    - Karina for the physical
    - Karina first:
        - Enters smoothly
        - Simply downloaded into the system
        - Process begins (fairly quite/quick process)
        - However, all of the lights in the crypt flicker
            - Loud reverberating thump (like something falling)
        - Lights all flicker to lighter blues then back to normal
        - Body coalesces inside the blue data stream field
        - Exits + forms into a slim human female (looks like Eva Green)
        - Dressed like Princess Sibylla (Kingdom of Heaven, in this promotional poster: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02PxQmHIQ5o)
    - Peter second:
        - Placed onto raised glowing pad
        - Several wires are stuck to his body/head (3-4)
        - Remembers wires/tank from his birth
        - Feels burning sensation
        - Opens mouth in wordless scream
        - Bits of vision/senses/bodily sensation fall away
        - Feels himself falling but never hits the floor (disintegrates)
        - Recognizes his conscious w/o the body in the storage system of the crypt
        - Various states of on/off + all instantaneously as he thinks
            - Can feel each individual packet of a thought individually/completely comprehends it instantaneously as it flows through his mind
        - Feels a “click” as the program finishes successfully converting him
        - “Door” in the program opens for him to exit the stasis field
        - Immediately feels his conscience fill the entire Bastion system/network
        - Suddenly can “see” as if he were surrounded by a mist of data streams
            - Data streams are fiery orange instead of calm blue now
        - Outline of a door-like shape
        - Dark and shadowy figures beyond
        - Begins pulling himself towards them and as he does he begins to feel bodily structures forming to facilitate his desire to exit
        - Several tedious seconds finally reaches the field and begins to push through
        - Foot forms on the other side of the field and comes into contact with the ground
        - Looks down and can see that it is on fire
        - Flames licking up his leg and scorching the very floor
        - Pulls the rest of his rapidly forming body through
        - As he passes through he can see that he is completely engulfed in flames clinging to his body
        - Each step sears a footprint into the metal floor
        - Comes to a stop before the others in the room
        - Fires die down then fully extinguish revealing a complete and clothed body as it was before he entered the crypt system
        - The others in the room look on in amazement
        - All of the lights in the crypt are orange like the field he left for a few moments before returning to their calming blue

notes: (discussion)
- Peter: “If only I could believe and live your way of life; our purposes would be fulfilled.  But your philosophy is false.  You maintain that through struggle the greater force will rule and so perfection will be found.  Yet when the struggle is over, perfection will not be found.  It is in and of this reason that your belief, your philosophy, is unsustainable.  For in its intended end, it becomes contrary to its intent.  A philosophy may move and have being when exposed to external stimuli but it never changes its form; it merely follows the musculature as laid out by the architect.  Should it ever do so, it would become unfounded and inevitably fall.”

notes: (scene)
- Peter in underground bunker tunnel (like Halo locations)
- Walking towards circular room with some light beaming down into central area
- Several pieces/robotic arms sticking into light
- Reaches center, stops/thinks for a few moments
- Extends/raises arms, begins to lift up on lightly glowing platform
- As ascends, armor is placed/rifts onto body
    - Most advanced/sleekest set of armor
    - Designed by the homo syntheticus (originally for them, Peter just uses it)
    - It is named “Solaluna” (“Sun and Moon”, has attributes of both)
- Reaches top + armor finished being assembled, platform stops (on top of small metal platform/pedestal)
- Overlooks entire battle, much commotion/explosions/fire/billowing smoke
    - Clear day otherwise
- Immediately jumps into fray
    - Runs forward/propels self into the air
        - With free hand (left if other is holding a weapon) makes a great sweeping motion along the ground
        - Throws a massive  dirt cloud/explosion into combatants + enters the fray
    - In battles (specifically the final duel between Peter/Restraint) Peter projects tactical readouts/directions/channels as he fights (e.g. arc of a punch/degrees, force applied, foot placements, striking angles, where the opponent needs to be placed, where they will strike next, etc.)

notes: (epilogue)
- Safe but executed to end Karina (kills himself?)
    - Peter executed + revived by digital implant/infusion (he had been exposed/transformed with it earlier in the story and his structure/layout was still there, revived with that + medical operations)
    - Narration occurring in Mr. Niccolo’s time frame (immediately after execution, without knowing Peter is/could be revived)
        - (All of the execution/stasis/operations occurring in the future?)
        - Peter taken down from execution
            - Why do we do everything that we do?
            - What makes us climb mountains when we could circumvent them?
            - What makes us strive when there is no reward?
            - What makes us struggle when there is no victory?
        - Transferred methodically to operation room
            - We are like ants but unlike ants we do not know why we do it
            - Our sacrifices are all in vein because there is no understanding
            - Humanity is living the purest and greatest sacrilege
            - But to the burning hearts of men there is no greater honor than to die not knowing why we snuff out those little points of eternal fire
        - Put into stasis (short time, to preserve body)
            - And what have we done here?
            - Only stripped a boy of his innocence
            - Pushed him ever upward towards his fate
            - From boy to king to god
            - Threw him to hell so that we could ascend to heaven
        - Doctors bring out item to revive Peter
            - Men move through their lives
            - They move with resolve; they move for the greater good
            - Is that a worthy epitaph?
        - Attach/operate/inject
            - It is no matter because that is all there is
            - And to do this men will remove their inhibitions and throw them away
            - Then men seemingly become greater than gods
            - From death, through life, with love
            - The end was decided long ago and we must find it
            - And when we do perhaps we will be vindicated; perhaps we will rise
