The next day, Peter woke and dressed in the bedroom the Iconians had given him.  

He donned his armor and somehow it felt even more ominous than when he had put it on the day before.  

Millie and Bernard met him at breakfast on a patio in the city overlooking the green valleys below. They managed to make some humorous conversation as the two looked on as Millie had her first meal ever.  

No one wanted to think about the inevitable discussion that was coming.  

Soon they were summoned by Restraint who inquired as to how they were feeling. Both Peter and Millie indicated that they were sore but functional from the prior day's ordeal. Restraint nodded her approval and then said that just the three of them would be engaging in the final discussion.  

Peter took Bernard aside.  

"Get word to the captain and prepare for battle. Tell him to activate the contingency resources and get them in motion."  

"Yes, sir. My company conducted a stealth drop last night and their in position in the planetary maintenance tunnels I identified yesterday."  

There was a brief pause.  

"Peter..."  

It was so rare that she used his actual name it somewhat jarred Peter to hear it.  

Her tone was laced with concern and something else. He wondered what it could be. Well, he knew what it was, he just wanted to pretend to wonder.  

Reaching out he took her hand. He wanted to say something but nothing came out. Instead she squeezed his hand and then was gone.  

Peter stood starring where she had been for a little while trying to collect his thoughts.  

He sighed and walked back to join Millie and Restraint.  

"It is time" said Restraint.  

Restraint glided into the air on her own power.  

Peter and Millie, both wearing their armor, lifted from the ground with propulsors of their own. The trio flew out over the mounts and over rolling hills of short grass.  

Restraint alighted on a small stone platform among the green landscape occassionally broken by scattered round rocks. Her companions followed suit.  

It was beautiful and tranquil. Wind blew by them in gusts and was the only sound they could hear.  

Millie and Peter looked at each other.  

Both had a intense look of worry etched on their respective faces. Peter wondered whether this could all be avoided. He dreaded what came next but he knew deep down that it was inevitable.  

Millie spoke first.  

"I am resolute in my decision" she said with a firm but sad voice. "We must do this. We must make this final sacrifice."  

It was like she had read what he had been thinking from first learning of the prophecy up until that very moment.  

How he wished so desperately that he could really accept them. Looking back now, he could see that his little hope yesterday was just a lie to himself - a way of prolonging what was to come.  

Now he accepted it.  

He and Millie were on opposite sides of this great issue. And he knew that she knew that too. Even Restraint likely knew it. All that remained was to speak the unspoken into reality.  

And he wanted desparately to be anywhere else. Be anyone else.  

But here he was. Just Peter. Always Peter.  

The butterflies were back in his stomach.  

He took a deep breath.  

"I cannot" he said. "Humanity must be left to its own devices, for good or for evil. No one can take the direction of all onto themselves. Neither the leader or the follower would be human in doing so."  

Millie's voice became pleading.  

"But every action mankind takes, both for good and for evil, are just the two feet it uses while traveling down a path to perfection. With each step of good it finds solid ground that it can place its weight upon. And every bad step finds unsteady terrain unfit to support it and adjusts accordingly. Both are equally useful! I'm not arguing that this isn't a bad thing for us to do but in the end it will prevent all other bad things from ever even happening."  

"I wish, I really, really wish I could believe that" Peter said. "Our purpose here, yours and mine, would be fulfilled. We could go back to _Pangea_. We could work on the estate and just be ourselves. No more mantles, no more prophecies."  

He paused for a moment before continuing.  

"But to get there is too great a sacrifice. Even if there were no resistence to the authority of Icon, humanity would be enslaved forever. That's no perfection. It's contrary to what ITAM intended. It's contrary to what nature intended."  

He took a step towards Millie.  

"And I know you know this. We both want this more than anything - to be able to rest. But that's not our destiny. We're here to struggle for humanity. I'm not offering you a better alternative but I am offering you the right way forward."  

Millie turned away. She looked out over the low rolling grassy hills.  

"We must do this."  

"Millie, we can't."  

"It's alreayd in motion. The prophecy is being fulfilled."  

Her voice now rang with certainty.  

"I am the Iconodule. You are the Iconoclast. Only one must remain."  

"Millie, please. Millie..."  

"There will be no bloodshed after this final bloodshed. I promise."  

A blade materialized in her hand and with a flash she spun whipping the sword at Peter's torso.  

But he had already rifted away leaving Millie and Restraint looking on. He appeared in a maintenance tunnel below the ground not far from where he had been but concealed from his former companions.  

Peter was crestfallen.  

His friend was gone.  

Lost like all the rest before her. But her betrayal was through an honorable corruption which somehow made it all the more painful.  

With a sigh, he began jogging down the tunnel until he came across Bernard with her company armed and ready for battle.  

Bernard read his face.  

"It's happened."  

Peter nodded sadly.  

"So now we make a stand."  

"We must" said Peter.
