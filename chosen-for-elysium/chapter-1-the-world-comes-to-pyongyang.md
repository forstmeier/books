> Following the quelled Lewisian uprising, the Federation of Pangea went through another phase of restructuring. Under the guidance of Field Marshal Peter, military control was temporarily established in order to form the successor state the Most Serene Confederacy of Parliamentary Autocephalates (MSCPA). Member autocephalates were encouraged to self-governor, and avoid overly-centralized power, within the broader confederation and while its formation was not smooth, it rapidly settled into a prosperous nation and a leader within civilization. Field Marshal Peter resumed his role as Proctor with a scaled down portfolio of his former duties.  
>  
> One notable external threat that rose was the People's Republic of Asia (PROA) which came to power in the vacuum following the Lewisian defeat. Eventually it began challenging the MSCPA and attacking supply lines and outputs in an effort to seize territory. While Proctor Peter attempted to avoid conflict, it inevitably came whem the PROA officially declared war on the autocephalates prompting the MSCPA to respond.

Peter stood on the bridge of the battleship _Creature of Splendid Glory_ amid the bustle of the crew preparing for battle.  

Focusing on the hum of activity did little to calm the flutter in his stomach. No matter how many major battles he participated in, he always got the jitters right beforehand.  

But this operation had him particularly nervous. He'd accomplished feats like this before but only in the heat of the moment and not _nearly_ on the same scale as what they were about to attempt.  

Below him through the glass floor of the forward bridge was the expansive landscape of _Pangea_. Several small moonlets orbited above them and from his vantaged point, she looked like a real planet, her shell underside out of sight. Throughout the lower atmosphere and scattered along the ground were hundreds of ships, vehicles, and weapons all mobilized for war.  

Millie appeared over his shoulder.  

"Nervous?"  

"Like always."  

"Me too."  

"I'm still not entirely sure that's possible for you."  

"Eh, you'd be surprised what an AI can develop over time."  

Peter shook his head in amusement, temporarily forgetting their situation. 

He and Millie were a tight working pair. Surviving ordeal after ordeal and facing trial after trial, their friendship had deepened over their years together. She'd been instrumental in bringing about the prosperity of the autocephalates and was dedicated to their continued peace.  

Occasionally when they would talk, he got the sense that the conflicts had disillusioned her but she was still as effective a partner as ever.  

The two chatted and the nerves were put at bay for a little while.  

Eventually, a holographic notification pinged before him. Peter waved his hand and an image of High General Doyle appeared before him. In the wake of the Lewisian uprising, she had been promoted and had mastermined and was commanding the operation they were preparing to undertake.  

"Proctor" she said by way of greeting.  

"General."  

"All units are in position" she said in a voice brimming with energy. "The fleet-wide notice just went out. Are you ready?"  

Peter took a deep breath.  

"Yes, ma'am."  

Doyle nodded.  

"Excellent."  

And with that, the operation was a go. The hologram of her disappeared and a moment later all of the lights in the ship dimmed to be replaced with red running lights like the ships or submarines of old wars.  

A robotic voice spoke over the intercom: "ALERT: BATTLE STATIONS. ALERT: ALL PERSONNEL PREPARE TO RIFT. REPEAT: ALL PERSONNEL PREPARE TO RIFT. ALERT: BATTLE STATIONS."  

The bustling quickly subsided the crew quickly settled into their assigned positions.

The tension was palpable in the room. Silent but palpable.

All eyes turned towards Peter still standing out at the front of the bridge. He briefly clenched his gauntleted hands by his sides, trying to wring the energy from his body.  

"We can do this" whispered Millie in his ear.  

The _Creature_ began to tilt backwards as did all of the other ships in low orbit above _Pangea_ pointing their bows out towards the starscape above.  

Doyle's voice now came over the intercom, "All vessels, prepare to rift on my mark."  

That was Peter's cue.  

He closed his eyes.  

Doyle began a countdown.  

"Three..."  

A deep breath in.  

"Two..."  

A deep breath out.  

"One..."  

Peter raised his hands upwards and out in unison with Millie.  

He could feel her helping in this great exertion.  

"Mark!"  

In a split second, dark smoke whipped about him, snapped through the bulkheads, consumed the entire fleet, and all of _Pangea_ below them. Nothing was visible for less than a second and as rapidly as it had appeared, the smoke dissipated.  

There was no longer a starfield before them but the great full sphere of Earth.  

It was so close that the highest clouds for both _Pangea_ and Earth were nearly blending together.  

Far below, or above, them in the sky was eastern Asia with eastern Russia, China, Japan stretching out below them with the Korean peninsula as their destination for this preemptive strike.  

Without skipping a beat, Doyle's voice barked over the intercom, "All vessels, begin the assault!"
