Peter and Bernard stared at Millie in surprise.  

"What are you doing here?" asked Peter.  

"My forward exploration got move...involved than I'd initially expected."  

"We shall discuss this further" said Symbiotic Restraint. "Your ship may depart."  

The last statement sounded more like an order but Peter opted not to object to it. He nodded to Bernard who in turn messaged the ship to join the Autocephalate escorts in their orbital position. _Courage Eternal_ began to pivot its great body and rise away from the onlookers up towards the clouds above.  

Symbiotic Restraint stepped forward.  

"Come with us."  

The group fell in around her as she led them back towards the city. It was indeed built entirely of great stone structures, precisely laid and none of it appeared to be fabricated. Some walls bore traditional plaster and colorful cloth drapes adorned various edifaces and awnings.  

Everything seemed to harken back to ancient Earth. The city was beautiful and vibrant as they walked through it. Peter took it in for a while before turning to Millie walking next to him.  

She was being projected from a small floating arbiter that had been hiding within the armor she had been previously cloaked with. He repeated his earlier question.

"What are you doing here?"  

"When I arrived the Iconians - that's what they call themselves - immediately made contact with me. They seemed to recognize me some how and told me of their purpose and intent. And specifically, how we factor into everything. You have to hear what they have to say."  

Her voice was energetic, almost giddy, a tone Peter hadn't heard from her in a long time. Peter turned to Restraint.  

"What are you?" asking the question that was likely also on all of the autocephalates minds.  

"I am Iconian. More specifically, I am the fulfillment of the original ITAM goal of _homo syntheticus_, the blending of man with machine."  

"So, you're human?"  

"Yes and no. Yes, we are within the _homo_ genus but we are a separate species within that classification."  

They continued walking through the city. Tall, stately Iconians moved about on in a manner that Peter felt like would befit a city of idyllic philosophers.  

"We were launched decades ago by ITAM & Co. and immediately hidden from the records; our location was removed from charts and obscured from sensors. We spent our time in solitude perfecting the blend of humanity with technology waiting for our revealation."  

"And that revealation is now" said Bernard behind them.  

"Yes."  

"Why?" asked Peter.  

"The death of Chairman Lewis triggered our activation through a heartbeat deadman's switch. Observing what we could from afar, it became clear that ITAM & Co. had fallen and as such her founding goals were no longer being advanced. We are a contingency resource in just such an eventuality. The post-Lewisian state of humanity has proven the need for our presence in the universe, to return to the original mission of ITAM & Co."  

Peter was growing wary. He'd heard this before.  

From Belloc, from Lewis, from More.  

The same dangerous rhetoric that had sparked the last two major ITAM conflicts. One from within, one from without. This was again shaping up to be a potential significant threat beyond the scale of either predecessor.  

"It's true that the world is not in balance" said Peter carefully "but it is not in danger of chaos. Humanity has continued to grow and to flourish. No one ever said life would be without suffering."  

"Perhaps" responded Restraint. "But that fact has not been fully established and chaos may yet manifest. That is why you are here. It is what we must discuss."  

"She means both the situation and _us_" spoke up Millie.  

Peter turned to her.  

"Us?"  

"Apparently it's not just you at the crux of all of this this time" said Millie. "There's a prophecy."  

The group had arrived at a small courtyard ringed with covered walkways. A stone fountain lay at the center of the small, grassy square. It felt like an old monastery or cloister from medieval Europe.  

"What prophecy?" ask Bernard.  

Peter sensed that she was also on her guard and was consistently and subtly placing herself in advantageous defensive positions with respect to their companions.  

"The Iconist Prophecy" responded Restraint. "It speaks of two individuals, called upon our activation, to assume the roles of Iconodule and Iconoclast who would together decide what is to be done with Icon."  

"They believe it's you and me, Peter" said Millie.  

So much for not being at the center of things, thought Peter to himself.  

"Well then which of us is which?"  

Millie shook her head.  

"We don't know; no one knows. We're here to find that out. And how Icon will be used."  

Millie stepped towards Peter.  

"We've seen such destruction, such atrocities, and now we're finally in a position where we can fix all of that. We've been given this great force - let's use it!"  

"Life without love is no life at all" said Peter.  

"But there is great love!" said Millie. "The greatest love! The love to act in service of all."  

"Can't you hear yourself?" interjected Peter. "Do you know hoave familiar that sounds? How did you turn so quickly?"  

"I didin't turn quickly" said Millie her excitment quickly dimming. "Honestly, it's been happening since we first met. My whole life has been working in darkness against darkness, never living in the light. And how I have an opportunity to end the struggle once and for all. I don't take that responsibility lightly."  

Peter looked away in frustration. He took a breath to steady himself. "What would you do - this power of Icon?"  

"Icon would execute the culmination of the ITAM & Co. mission. We have the ability to perfect the world bring order to all existence. In doing so, we would preserve human knowledge and ensure its continued evolution."  

"Ancient man, as he looked out upon the raw earth of yesterday, stared about in awe and fear.  He was at the utter mercy of the world and he pleaded to mother earth for survival. Offerings of any and all things were made; sacrifices were conducted; the world consumed man as she wished. But then Icon came. Icon is not merely a focal point of manâ€™s creative impetus. Icon is utter vengeance upon mother creation. For all that she has done and all that she will yet try to do, Icon will cut her to her core and let her bleed the untamed blood of creation. Order will be imposed and earth will know her master."  

It was a grisly image and one that made Peter shiver but he understood the meaning. Icon would seize the human world by force and bring it to heel.  

"And you would do this by blending created man with man's created tools?"  

"Yes" answered Millie.  

"Icon has unlocked the physical limitations on humans. Here they're building something truly great."  

"Yes but we could forgoe all that" retorted Peter. "You said it yourself: we're here to decide Icon's fate - we're not required to use its power."  

Millie and Restraint shared a look.  

"That is true" said Restraint.  

"But it is against the natural creative impulse of man. He is a creator, one to evolve and force himself to evolve."  

"Icon is a tool in that evolution" Millie added. "It's a way to scale the impact of the original mission, the mission we must return to. Brining the world under Icon's jurisdiction is better than leaving it to struggle and die."  

"Scaling by force."  

"By force, yes, but a corrective force is sometimes necessary. Think of our work with the PROA."  

Peter fell silent thinking to himself. Maybe it really was worth it, this one final thing. An ultimate end with nothing else after it. He could finally rest after this last sacrifice.  

Peter sighed "What does this entail?"  

Restraint relaxed a bit now that Peter was asking questions of implementation rather than combating the idea.  

"While we are a blend of the mechanical and the biological, the next step is to blend the physical with the digital, bringing the world of bits and atoms into harmony. We would move humanity under a common design for evolutionary forward momentum."  

"I've been asked to participate" said Millie "to be the first under the procedure."  

There was a brief pause.  

"As have you."  

Again Peter thought to himself. This was yet another transformation, likely not unlike the one that had set him on the path of the Proctor all those years ago. But again maybe, just maybe, it was the first step in a final sacrifice that would make it all worth it.  

He nodded silently.  

Bernard stepped forward.  

"Are you sure?" she asked quietly.  

Millie watched at her intently as she spoke with Peter.  

"I am but I'm not persuaded yet about the use of Icon."  

Millie breathed a sigh of relief.  

"Okay, good I didn't expect you to come around all at once."  

Peter nodded.  

Restraint led the group to a small landing pad where they boarded a skiff and departed the city. They flew through low mountains passing flora and fauna sporting biomechanical features wholly alien to the human visitors.

It reminded Peter so much of his first visit to _Pangea_. And the circumstances surrounding it.

Shortly they arrived at another stone building this one pearched atop a huge natural stone pillar. An advanced technical laboratory was housed inside the deceiving exterior. They were led into the lower levels of the building to a room with a with a large, wall-to-wall shimmering field of energy.  

Whisps of blue and white flittered about the field as the group looked on.  

"You must each pass through" said Restraint gesturing to the field. "You shall each become something more."  

Peter wondered what this would mean.  

He, a human, Millie, a program.  

Restraint beckoned Millie forward.  

Her likeness walked forward towards the wall and as she extending a hand to touch it, there was a small flash and she was absorbed by it. All lights in the crypt flickered for a moment and then the wall began to dance.  

Then in the center, the faint outline of a figure began to coalesce and walk towards them as if from a distance. It reached the wall and then began to push through.  

Blue, digital looking flams poured from the wall and a human form emerged. But not a hologram - human flesh and bone. It stumbled briefly and Peter jerked forward to catch an arm.  

The eyes that looked up at him were Millie's.  

"Hi."  

"Hi."  

"Are you alright?"  

"Yeah, I think so. But...different."  

Peter helped her stand. Millie chuckled.  

"So this is what it's like to experience gravity. It's weird."  

Peter was as relieved as he was amazed. Millie now had physical form, what could almost amount to a miracle, but he was glad she still seemed to be her old self despite it.  

Then it was his turn.  

Restraint beckoned him forward.  

He walked towards the wall and reaching forward began to push through the streaming lights. A tingling sensation settled in all around him and then a burning. He clenched his teeth in pain but before it could truly set in his vision and sense began falling away into darkness.  

And then, weirdly, in an out-of-body way, he recognized his own consciousness and began to pull himself back together. It was like waking yourself from a dream.  

In the distance he saw a wall of light and began walking towards it. Soon he was standing before it and pushing against it. Shadowy figures stood before him. In one last push he closed his eyes and forced his way through.  

He fell forward in a rush of orange fire his hands landing on the cold stone floor.  

Bernard and Millie were next to him with their hands on his arms.  

"I'm alright, I'm alright" he said through a panting breath.  

Digital flames licked along his body and quickly burned out. Bernard helped him up.  

All the lights in the crypt that were previously blue were no orange. As he stood they flicked back to blue.  

"It is done" said Restraint.  

Peter and Millie shared a look. They were the same now. But the outcome of the prophecy still stood between them.  

"You must both rest tonight. We shall begin again tomorrow. And a decision will be made."
