Shortly after the dinner, the expedition's escort met with _Courage Eternal_ and jumped to hyperspace without delay. There was still some travel to be done, and Peter spent most of the jump thinking to himself.  

A knock on his bedroom door brought him back to reality.  

"Yes?"  

The door opened and Bernard entered now clad in her battle gear.  

"We're arriving in a few minutes."  

Peter nodded and stood; he too was armored and prepared for battle should it come. Bernard led the way to the bridge. Both were silent the whole way each in their own thoughts.  

Liu turned to greet them as they entered the bridge - a streaming field of blue and white visible beyond the observation deck windows.  

"We'll be making the drop in a few moments" said Liu.  

They all turned to look through the forward viewports.  

A familiar flutter rose in Peter's stomach. Every time, he thought to himself, every time. At least he could take solace in that consistency.  

One day, he silently hoped, he could _just_ be in charge of managing small projects and not have to lead these massive operations.  

"Coming out of hyperspace now" one of the crew said.  

Before them the streaming lights broke apart then coalesced into a starfield.  

Far out before them was a sole planet and further beyond its star. The planet looked to be partially engulfed in a grey-brown cloud of indeterminate material.  

Around them the escort ships fell into place as Liu reviewed messages coming in on a hologram before him.  

"All escorts have arrived and have assumed their positions" said Liu.  

"Very good, begin the approach."  

_Courage Eternal_ and her support ships began making their way towards the planet before them.  

"Captain" shouted one of the crew "two capital ships are approaching on an intercept course. They're indicating that they're our escort and to follow their directions."  

Liu looked to Peter who nodded consent.  

"Acknowledge their request and send our consent" ordered Liu.  

Peter and Bernard shared a look before looking out through the observation deck viewports at the incoming ships. They weren't as large as _Courage Eternal_ but they were still impressive and fiercely armed.  

Moving in close, one arced above while they other ducked below _Courage Eternal_ and took up places on either side of the ship. No further communications came from the vessels but the message was clear: don't stray from the course.  

As they drew closer to the planet, the escorts began maneuvering themselves between _Courage Eternal_ and her escorts.  

"Captain, the escorts are requesting instructiosn on how to handle the incursion" called out a crewmember "Should they push back and hold their positions?"  

"No, they want us to follow them in alone. Order the escorts to assume an orbital cover position" said Liu.  

"Acknowledged."  

Moments later, the accompanying Autocephalacy ships began peeling off and heading into a higher vantage point above the three ships now very near the planet.  

Peter could now see that the great cloud partially shrouding the planet was in fact an enormous swarm of small ships and machines. They seemed to be active with steady streams moving about with the purpose of a honey bee hive. Portions of the planet's surface could be seen through the mechanical cloud and it was clear that it was an artificial construct - one that the swarm appeared to be working on even at that moment.  

The size of the construct dwarfed even that of _Pangea_ as it was a complete planetary construction not just a partial shell. Whoever had summoned them were formidable technologists and likely ahead of even the Autocephalates.  

The swarm parted as they approached and dipped into the atmosphere revealing a beautiful and lush landscape below.  

Shallow blue seas and pristine forests were broken by high, white-capped mountains and near-white deserts.  

They had conducted a similar terraforming to that found onboard _Pangea_ but slightly alien. Somehow _too_ perfect or _too_ orderly in its arrangements.  

Their escorts continued guiding them further and further into the atmosphere and they continued to follow the wordless directings being given them.  

Green mountains rose up before them with a great stone complex built across their peaks reminiscent of Earth's Machu Pichu but larger and clearly active.  

The escorts guided forward bridge of _Courage Eternal_ to just in front of one of these peaks upon which was a flat stone platforms and standing figures waiting their arrival. _Courage Eternal_ came to a gradual halt with their observation deck looking down on the figures not far in front of them.  

"We're here" said Bernard.  

"And they're expecting us" replied Peter.  

He turned to the captain, "Wait here while Bernard and I make contact."  

"Yes, sir."  

Bernard and Peter made their way to a forward hatch below the bridge and opened it to the fresh air of the alien world. They dropped down and proppelled themselves across the short distance to their reception.  

Alighting on the stone platform, they took in the scene before them carefully.  

Before the two stood tall, thin, humaniod beings covered in great armor and masks.  

One stepped forward and it's ornate mask broke apart into pieces and floated away revealing a slim, hairless humanlike female face but with greyer tint and with small nostrils. Piercing blue eyes sized them up.  

"Welcome to Icon" she said with a bow which Peter and Bernard reciprocated.  

"I am Symbiotic Restraint, Potifex of Icon" she said. "You have been summoned to answer a great prophecy."  

Peter and Bernard shared a sidelong look.  

"But before we address the prophecy, let me introduce why you are here."  

She stepped aside and another figure stepped forward. It was similarly arrayed in armor and a mask but was average human height and build. The armor was also significantly more ornate than the others in the group.  

Its great circular mask and armor plating broke apart revealing a holographic body beneath.  

"Hello, Peter" said Millie with a smile.
