Peter read and reread the short message before him.  

He turned to look at the accompanying coordinates sent with the message and then back to the message. Millie hovered over him, wringing her hands in agitation.  

"I really don't understand what this is" he said with a sigh.  

"And I really don't understand why it was so important that we had to pull ourselves from the battlefield."  

Not that it really mattered. Even as they were leaving, Bernard and the other companies had done their work spectacularly and paved the way for the bulk of the ground forces to being taking the city in full.  

Despite the lack of Millie and Peter on the field, the outcome was now inevitable. The battle was all but over, and even with the human shields throwing a wrench in their original plans, had more or less unfolded as they had hoped. This would be a significant blow to the PROA and would hopefully put them on their heels and consider coming to the bargaining table.  

No official capitulation was likely to come but at least they could begin moving _Pangea_ away from Earth and shore up their defenses against any possible revenge counter strikes. For all intents and purposes, it looked as though the PROA had been resoundingly put back in its place with its home fleet effectively wiped out and capital city fallen.  

None of this seemed to register at all with Millie, her face a twisted expression of worry.  

"It's not so much the message itself" she said. "It's where it _came from_ is what's concerning. And where those coordinates point to."  

She waved her hand and a star map appeared before them. "Right here" she said pointing to a small system "is where those coordinates are pointing to."  

Peter shrugged.  

"And?"  

"And it didn't exist yesterday."  

"Meaning we hadn't seen it before?"  

"Meaning we had charted that area previously and, according to all measurements, what is now there was not before. That and the fact that the message is bearing old ITAM encryptions which makes even less sense since we've never had operations in that vicinity before."  

Peter's brow furrowed. That was odd.  

"What do you suggest?"  

Millie pursed her lips in thought for a moment.  

"I think we need to investigate" she said confidently. "We should bring a small, mobile escort group in the event it's a hostile situation. But we should leave immediately."  

"Alright, let's do that."  

The rest of that day and into the evening _Pangea_ and the Autocephalate forces withdrew from Earth having completed their mission.  

Early in the following morning, Peter and Millie prepared to depart. Peter looked at the small Proctor estate as they boarded the skiff to bring them to their ship. It was a small collection of building in the small city of Bojaxhiu - unobtrusive but still more connected than he had been in his hermit days in the grasslands of _Pangea_.  

"Every time I leave my office, something crazy always happens."  

"Well at least you know that" said Bernard beside him with a smile. She and her company would be joining the mission at Peter's request. If they were going to face an unknown it helped to have Bernard there in the event things got ugly.  

They boarded the skiff and shot out across the landscape towards the very edge of the _Pangea_ shell. After a short while, their destination became visible in the distance before them.  

A great ship, parked over the very edge of _Pangea_, with gangplanks running from the land up to its massive hull. The _Courage Eternal_ - one of four new first rate ships that had been commissioned by the MSCPA. She was capable of mounting prolonged engagements against entire sectors if need be and would be an ideal mobile operations base for their upcoming mission.  

It had been launched recently and had participated in suppressing potential counter attacks from the PROA in the battle the day before. However, she had not had a proper christening and a throng of newly-returned civilians and military had formed to see her off.  

The skiff halted and they disembarked onto a carpeted walkway surrounded by cheering crowds. They were jubilant from the victory and the launch of this symbol of the Autocephalates strength.  

Peter walked over to a small podium and looked on as an official's wife smashed the champagne bottle on the side of the ship to an eruption of applause. After applauding with the crowd he shook her hand and turned to walk down the carpet raising his hand in small waves to the crowd. Arriving at the bottom of the walkway, he turned and raised both hands to the crowd to another round of applause before turning and climbing up into the ship.  

Bernard had gone ahead and was standing next to the ships captain.  

"Welcome abord, Proctor" he said stepping forward to shake Peter's hand. "I'm Captain Liu. It's a pleasure to have you aboard the true maiden voyage of _Couarge Eternal_."  

"Thank you for taking us" said Peter. "Once we're sufficiently under way, we'll fill you in on the details of the mission."  

"Excellent, I appreciate that. Now if you'd like, feel free to observe the launch."  

Peter nodded thanks and walked out onto the glass-floored observation deck of the bridge. Millie appeared next to him bouncing her knee in anticipation.  

"You're going to give yourself an aneurism if you keep fidgeting" Peter joked.  

"Ha ha. Very funny" said Millie. "I'm just glad we're going already."  

"We'll sort this all out, don't worry."  

"That's just it - I don't really feel like there's something there for us to sort out. I feel like...it's going to be something to sort _us_ out."  

Peter looked at her. She'd been acting very strange and, now that he thought of it, had been for some time now.  

"I think, I think I should try and go ahead" she said finally.  

"Can you do that?"  

"Yeah, I think so. I think I can backtrack how the message was sent and upload myself over there."  

Peter was a bit nervous at this suggestion. "Is this really a good idea?"  

"...I don't know, but I think I should."  

Peter paused a moment.  

"Okay. But be safe."  

Millie perked up for the first time that day.  

"I will. I'll see you soon!"  

With a small wave she disappeared. Peter wondered if they'd just made a huge mistake. He didn't have long to dwell on that thought though as behind him he heard Captain Liu.  

"Take her to sky, commander!"

A rumble gently shook the ship as her engines came to life. Slowly, her bow swung out and over the edge of the _Pangea_ shell and the crowd below - Peter raised his hand in acknowledgement of their joy. Waving grasslands were replaced by a sea of stars in a black field as _Courage Eternal_ began making her way towards the rendezvous point with their escort group.  

Once they were fully on their way, Peter brought Bernard and Captain Liu into a briefing room and informed them of the mission. Both were skeptical as to what the utility was but were willing to accept the Proctor's insistence that it was crucial.  

Prior to leaving, Peter had also requested that Doyle place additional resources on alert as backup should they be needed. It was a tough ask given their immediate concerns with the PROA but she acquiesced.  

That evening Liu formally invited Peter and Bernard to a dinner with the ranking officers. Peter waited in the anteroom for Bernard as the officers began arriving wearing black robes he had packed for the occasion which had been preplanned.  

And then he saw her.  

Bernard came around the corner in a dark dress that fell to her ankles. Her hair normally roughly wound in a bun now fell around her face with one side tucked behind her ear. A small necklace glinted as she walked over to Peter.  

Peter looked on in an astonished silence.  

His look must have given him away because Bernard blushed slightly when she reached him - the first time he'd ever seen her off guard.  

He extended his arm which she accepted and the two went in to the dinner. It was a lovely meal and engaging company. Peter couldn't help but keep looking over at the transformed Bernard chatting with her naval peers taking her in.  

Eventually the dinner ended and various groups split off chatting amongst themselves or heading off for the night. Peter walked over to Bernard who was standing before a viewport looking out at the starfield before her.  

She was quietly singing to herself - another first for Peter to observe.  

> "...there is a billion stars above - I know - but you're the one who lights my way..."  

He came up beside her and she turned to him.  

"Life is so different off the battlefield" she said.  

"It is."  

"And I wonder...if I'm so made for battle...is it possible for me to have it?"  

"It is."  

"I wonder if you could show me it."  

Before Peter could respond Liu came up to them.  

"Pardon the interruption, but would the two of you care to join me for a post-dinner drink in my study?"  

"Thank you, captain, of course" responded Peter. But he wanted to address what Bernard had just asked.  

In the captain's study, the three posted themselves around his fire in oversized chairs seemingly from another era.  

"You probably don't remember this" started Liu "but I served with you during the Lewisian uprising. At the battle of Jerusalem specifically. That was...quite the day we had."  

He swirled his drink before taking a sip. Holding his glass in both hands he looked over at Peter.  

"What are we getting ourselves into out here?"  

Peter looked at the fire.  

A great deal had happened in the past few days and he wasn't exactly sure what to think. He wondered how Millie was and if she was safe.  

"Honestly, I don't know" he said. "I know that's absolutely the last thing any captain wants to hear as he takes his ship into unknown waters but it's all I have. But I do know that it's essential. Millie believes so and I believe Millie."  

Liu sighed.  

"It will have to do."  

Bernard spoke up "And so will we."
