                • Several small groups of the “religion” that had grown up around Peter
                    ◦ He has just accepted them and let them continue in their ways
                    ◦ Quietly/passively acknowledges them and moves along without engaging/directly accepting them
            ▪ Space port:

                • Arrives at the bottom of the boarding ramp where Arthur approaches again and removes the hat and places it back with the attendant
                • Peter walks up the ramp without turning/acknowledging the crowd
                • Note: similar to the launching of the Titanic (“Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch”)

        - icon description:
            • everal levels (e.g. outer shell, inner shell, planet surface, separated core, etc.) all being utilized efficiently/perfectly
                ◦ Outer shell is bright (like the moon), and reflective, white light + design work on the surface
                    ▪ Outside of shell has large deserts (mostly dunes), large oases, several large/moderately deep clear oceans, several crystalline glass cities laid out in intricate patterns visible from space, several large/small entrances to the interior layers
                        • Oceans: never deep enough to not see all the way to the bottom of the ocean
                        • Landscape: almost entirely made up of sand + dunes but there are outcroppings of individual standing stones (not enormous)
                            ◦ These stones are also present under the oceans
                        • Sand: possibly used as a light collection mechanism
                    ▪ Inside of shell has buildings on it pointing towards inner surface, obscured from inside view by perpetual clouds (clear/sunny/blue)
                        • Few buildings, mostly maintenance/cap to a connection to the outer surface
                        • Largely for functional purposes
                    ▪ Several very small “moons” inside the outer shell, suspended above inner surface, host housing/construction sites
                        • Several small planetoids within the outer layer of Bastion (slowly hovering/orbiting inner layer), used as mining/material providers, also house libraries/sanctuaries/crypts/stasis chambers/etc.
                    ▪ Giant robots (skinnier, more tactile hands, human like bodies, etc.) used on Bastion for maintenance
                        • Utilized as war machines in Bastion battles
                        • Use wrestling/throw moves on one another
                ◦ Lush/technologically integrated interior (biotechnology), perfect specimens of everything human-related
                    ▪ Bastion has seas + oceans + lakes on its surface (inner terraformed surface)
                    ▪ Flora on Bastion (some of it) is bio-mechanical, aware of surroundings, used as defensive measures
                    ▪ Snow zones (in mountainous areas) have lava/red lights among the snow
                ◦ Cities (or main city) on Bastion have similar mountainous/steep structure as Machu Picchu (note: not the island where Peter meets the homo syntheticus leader)
                    ▪ Cities/large constructions are few and far between
                    ▪ Typically built into the natural environment
                    ▪ Also several large hovering cities similar to Forerunner structures on Requiem (rising up through the clouds and the sections above the clouds look like the cover art for Two Steps From Hell: Skyworld)
                ◦ Inner core, molten lava (liquid servers/power generators in lava)
                ◦ Harvest planet
                    ▪ Planets mined/harvested to nothing
                    ▪ Precious minerals/components
                    ▪ Core hollowed away (floats in center), material harvested through mine shafts (through mantle/crust) by orbiting satellites
                    ▪ Many factories/operational machinery grafted into/onto planet

	- possible intro (and discussed in the chapter)
		- Title: Iconist Prophecy
		- Two people come: the Iconodule/Iconoclast
		- One to create, one to destroy
		- The debate is over which is which in order to side with one and combat the other (Karina v Peter debates)
			- Eventually Restraint (incorrectly) assumes that Karina is the Iconodule and Peter is the Iconoclast leading to the Bastion War
				- As Bastion is destroyed in the war, Peter was actually the Iconodule and Karina was the Iconoclast
				- Should that been Restraint’s choice it would have happened
					- E.g. if Peter is selected as the Iconodule he would protect/save Bastion from Karina
					- E.g. if Peter is selected as the Iconoclast (which he is) he seeks to destroy/defeat Bastion
				- It is a self-fulfilling prophecy
					- Prophecy creates an action and either choice would result in the same outcome/actions
		- Describes Icon and its purpose
			- Acheiropoeta, icons not made by hand
				- Name of the capital city (Machu Pichu)
			- Caelestis, “of heaven”
	- [ ] note (possible dialogue)
		- Man is perpetually attempting to change his environment 
		- Even those individuals secluding themselves from society and becoming ascetics are changing their environment 
		- Inventors and murderers change their environments 
		- Everyone moves on their own impetus to build for themselves what they themselves see 
		- This vision can be either singular or collective 
		- Man is the creative beast 
	- [ ] note (possible dialogue)
		- Ancient man, as he looked out upon the raw earth of yesterday, stared about in awe and fear.  He was at the utter mercy of the world and he pleaded to mother earth for survival.  Offerings of any and all things were made; sacrifices were conducted; the world consumed man as she wished.  But then I came.  I am not merely a focal point of man’s creative impetus.  I am his utter vengeance upon mother earth.  For all that she has done and all that she will yet try to do, I will cut her to her core and let her bleed the untamed blood of creation.  Order will be imposed and earth will know her master.
	- [ ] note
		- Homo syntheticus mastered the bridge between data/physical existence and transference between the two
			- Blue stasis field, vertically moving light blue wisps/data streams
			- Dark/shadowy figure, slightly akimbo, standing amid light wisps
			- Once activated/released, data becomes more frantic in movements
			- Figure begins to move around
			- As exits the data stream, dark shadows transform into faint blue light data flows
			- All coalesce and form bones/muscles/implants
			- Form into a full homo syntheticus
			- Monasteries like Meteora, Greece + Mount Athos + etc.
				- Functioning communities and monasteries (some either/or)
				- Catholic monks on Bastion, either homo syntheticus or very human homo syntheticus
				- Aesthetics group:
					- Radical group within the Bastion forces
					- Biologically altered
					- Effectively underwent a chemotherapy-style alteration
						- Very long/intensive and mostly injection-based
					- Results in emaciated appearances/balding heads/ slender builds
					- Alterations create a biological bomb built into their DNA
						- Detonating/shaping the blast is determined by the detonating individual
					- Dress is loose fitting clothing/simple fabrics & clothes
					- Always smiling & never talking
					- Smooth/calm motions and hand gestures
					- Purpose (?)
		- Peter + Karina decide to participate
			- Peter for the digital
			- Karina for the physical
			- Karina first:
				- Enters smoothly
				- Simply downloaded into the system
				- Process begins (fairly quite/quick process)
				- However, all of the lights in the crypt flicker
					- Loud reverberating thump (like something falling)
				- Lights all flicker to lighter blues then back to normal
				- Body coalesces inside the blue data stream field
				- Exits + forms into a slim human female (looks like Eva Green)
				- Dressed like Princess Sibylla (Kingdom of Heaven, in this promotional poster: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02PxQmHIQ5o)
			- Peter second:
				- Placed onto raised glowing pad
				- Several wires are stuck to his body/head (3-4)
				- Remembers wires/tank from his birth
				- Feels burning sensation
				- Opens mouth in wordless scream
				- Bits of vision/senses/bodily sensation fall away
				- Feels himself falling but never hits the floor (disintegrates)
				- Recognizes his conscious w/o the body in the storage system of the crypt
				- Various states of on/off + all instantaneously as he thinks
					- Can feel each individual packet of a thought individually/completely comprehends it instantaneously as it flows through his mind
				- Feels a “click” as the program finishes successfully converting him
				- “Door” in the program opens for him to exit the stasis field
				- Immediately feels his conscience fill the entire Bastion system/network
				- Suddenly can “see” as if he were surrounded by a mist of data streams
					- Data streams are fiery orange instead of calm blue now
				- Outline of a door-like shape
				- Dark and shadowy figures beyond
				- Begins pulling himself towards them and as he does he begins to feel bodily structures forming to facilitate his desire to exit
				- Several tedious seconds finally reaches the field and begins to push through
				- Foot forms on the other side of the field and comes into contact with the ground
				- Looks down and can see that it is on fire
				- Flames licking up his leg and scorching the very floor
				- Pulls the rest of his rapidly forming body through
				- As he passes through he can see that he is completely engulfed in flames clinging to his body
				- Each step sears a footprint into the metal floor
				- Comes to a stop before the others in the room
				- Fires die down then fully extinguish revealing a complete and clothed body as it was before he entered the crypt system
				- The others in the room look on in amazement
				- All of the lights in the crypt are orange like the field he left for a few moments before returning to their calming blue

	- [ ] note: dialogue
		- Karina: “Every action mankind takes both good and evil, are merely the two feet it uses while traveling down a path of perfection.  With the good it finds solid ground on which it may place its weight, while with its bad it finds unsteady terrain unfit to support it and shifts weight back to the other appendage.  Both are equally useful in directing the path of human evolution and neither must be given more or less weight.  When it comes to human progress, we cannot overlook any means towards furthering the achievements of man.”
	- [ ] note: dialogue
		- Peter: “If only I could believe and live your way of life; our purposes would be fulfilled.  But your philosophy is false.  You maintain that through struggle the greater force will rule and so perfection will be found.  Yet when the struggle is over, perfection will not be found.  It is in and of this reason that your belief, your philosophy, is unsustainable.  For in its intended end, it becomes contrary to its intent.  A philosophy may move and have being when exposed to external stimuli but it never changes its form; it merely follows the musculature as laid out by the architect.  Should it ever do so, it would become unfounded and inevitably fall.”

			- Reaches top + armor finished being assembled, platform stops (on top of small metal platform/pedestal)
			- Overlooks entire battle, much commotion/explosions/fire/billowing smoke
				- Clear day otherwise
			- Immediately jumps into fray
				- Runs forward/propels self into the air
					- With free hand (left if other is holding a weapon) makes a great sweeping motion along the ground
					- Throws a massive  dirt cloud/explosion into combatants + enters the fray
				- In battles (specifically the final duel between Peter/Restraint) Peter projects tactical readouts/directions/channels as he fights (e.g. arc of a punch/degrees, force applied, foot placements, striking angles, where the opponent needs to be placed, where they will strike next, etc.)
        - battle scene:
            - Peter and Doge facing off
            - (set to Suns and Stars from Battlefield 1 trailer)
            - "greater" suits of armor called/fall into place
            - floating above ground
            - forming great eagles/phoenixes
            - soldiers leaping into battle around them
            - leap towards each other + clash
        - duel scene:
            * Realizes neither will want to kill the other
            * Both willing to die to stop the other
            * Peter accepts he must kill her and end her life
            * (Later)
            * Plants strong stance
            * Places sword defensively but "incorrectly"
            * A strong blow would dislodge the sword
            * Karina slices it from his hand (as expected/they both knew she would)
            * Sword wheels out over behind Peter's shoulder
            * Time seems to slows down to infinity
            * She pauses follow through swing waiting for him to leap away
            * He doesn't (unexpected to her because it is not in his self-interest)
            * Powerfully blasts her away and into a wall
	- epilogue
		- Safe but executed to end Karina (kills himself?)
		- Peter executed + revived by digital implant/infusion (he had been exposed/transformed with it earlier in the story and his structure/layout was still there, revived with that + medical operations)
		- Narration occurring in Mr. Niccolo’s time frame (immediately after execution, without knowing Peter is/could be revived)
			- (All of the execution/stasis/operations occurring in the future?)
			- Peter taken down from execution
				- Why do we do everything that we do?
				- What makes us climb mountains when we could circumvent them?
				- What makes us strive when there is no reward?
				- What makes us struggle when there is no victory?
			- Transferred methodically to operation room
				- We are like ants but unlike ants we do not know why we do it
				- Our sacrifices are all in vein because there is no understanding
				- Humanity is living the purest and greatest sacrilege
				- But to the burning hearts of men there is no greater honor than to die not knowing why we snuff out those little points of eternal fire
			- Put into stasis (short time, to preserve body)
				- And what have we done here?
				- Only stripped a boy of his innocence
				- Pushed him ever upward towards his fate
				- From boy to king to god
				- Threw him to hell so that we could ascend to heaven
			- Doctors bring out item to revive Peter
				- Men move through their lives
				- They move with resolve; they move for the greater good
				- Is that a worthy epitaph?
			- Attach/operate/inject
				- It is no matter because that is all there is
				- And to do this men will remove their inhibitions and throw them away
				- Then men seemingly become greater than gods
				- From death, through life, with love
				- The end was decided long ago and we must find it
				- And when we do perhaps we will be vindicated; perhaps we will rise
   - topics: necessity of action, selflessness, love
