		- [ ] p: what are you?
		- [ ] sr: iconian, more properly original itam goal _homo syntheticus_, blending man w/ machine

		- [ ] continue walking through city
		- [ ] tall + stately iconians moved about
		- [ ] not typical human activities
		- [ ] seemed like idyllic philosophers
		- [ ] sr: launched by itam decades ago, hidden from records, directly blended w/ technology, rapidly advanced, built this + more in stealth, waiting time revealation
		- [ ] p: that time is now
		- [ ] sr: yes
		- [ ] p: why?

		- [ ] of course we're back at the center
		- [ ] life never not pivotal world decisions
		- [ ] p: which is which
		- [ ] millie shook head

		- [ ] m: great love, preserve life
		- [ ] p: hear yourself, how not familiar, how turned so quickly

		- [ ] p: what would you do
		- [ ] sr: icon culmination itam mission, ability perfect world, spread order all existence, expand + preserve human knowledge + evolution
		- [ ] sr: Ancient man, as he looked out upon the raw earth of yesterday, stared about in awe and fear.  He was at the utter mercy of the world and he pleaded to mother earth for survival.  Offerings of any and all things were made; sacrifices were conducted; the world consumed man as she wished.  But then I came.  I am not merely a focal point of man’s creative impetus.  I am his utter vengeance upon mother earth.  For all that she has done and all that she will yet try to do, I will cut her to her core and let her bleed the untamed blood of creation.  Order will be imposed and earth will know her master.
		- [ ] p: by blending created man w/ man's creation?
		- [ ] m: yes, here icon has unlocked human limitations, helped build something great
		- [ ] p: but we could forgo that, we could decide to leave icon at bay
		- millie + restraint share look
		- [ ] sr: we could, but it is the natural evolution, Man is perpetually attempting to change his environment, Even those individuals secluding themselves from society and becoming ascetics are changing their environment, Inventors and murderers change their environments, Everyone moves on their own impetus to build for themselves what they themselves see, This vision can be either singular or collective,  Man is the creative beast 
		- [ ] m: icon tool in that evolution, way scale itam's original mission, under icon jurisdiction, scope all of humanity
		- [ ] p: by force
		- [ ] m: by force, but corrective force necessary, just as was our war with proa
		- [ ] peter things to himself
		- [ ] maybe it is worth it
		- [ ] one final thing
		- [ ] an ultimate end
		- [ ] nothing else after it
		- [ ] a final sacrifice
		- [ ] peter: what would it entail?
		- [ ] restraint relaxes a bit
		- [ ] r: just as blended mechanical w/ biological blending physical w/ digital, brining world of atoms and bits together, w/ humanity united under common design move evolution forward infinitely
		- [ ] m: i've been asked to particpate, to be the first
		- [ ] brief pause
		- [ ] m: as have you
		- [ ] peter thought to himself
		- [ ] yet another transformation
		- [ ] yet another evolution
		- [ ] but again thought maybe just maybe
		- [ ] final sacrifice worth it
		- [ ] finally nodded silently
		- [ ] bernard stepped forward
		- [ ] b: are you sure (said quietly)

	- notes:
		- [ ] next day rose
		- [ ] millie at breakfast
		- [ ] first time ever
		- [ ] chatted about nothing
		- [ ] neither wanted what was coming
		- [ ] bernard looked on
		- [ ] chiming in when asked
		- [ ] sore from ordeal but no time for furthe rest
		- [ ] summoned by restraint
		- [ ] just millie + peter
		- [ ] peter takes bernard aside
		- [ ] p: get word to captain, prepare for battle, very likely to come, also set the contingency resources in motion, company ready
		- [ ] b: yes sir, positioned location we identified yesterday
		- [ ] brief pause
		- [ ] b: peter...
		- [ ] rarely used his name
		- [ ] concerned + something else
		- [ ] wondered what it could be
		- [ ] he knew what it was
		- [ ] reached out + took her hand
		- [ ] wanted to say something
		- [ ] nothing came out
		- [ ] she squeezed hand + left
		- [ ] peter returned to millie
		- [ ] sr: it is time
		- [ ] lifted off from balcony
		- [ ] flew out over the mountains
		- [ ] rolling grassland
		- [ ] short grass dotted w/ round rocks
		- [ ] beautiful + tranquil
		- [ ] peter + millie followed suit
		- [ ] propelling w/ resources summoned to them
		- [ ] alighted on old stone circle
		- [ ] alone from all else
		- [ ] sr: it is time, declare your final intentions
		- [ ] millie + peter look each other
		- [ ] intently + w/ worry
		- [ ] millie spoke first
		- [ ] m: resolute, we must do this, a final sacrifice
		- [ ] peter heard words he had himself been thinking
		- [ ] but arrived opposite conclusion
		- [ ] p: i cannot, humanity must be left to its own devices, for good or evil, no one can take that upon themselves, they would be no longer human
		- [ ] millie voice pleading
		- [ ] m: very action mankind takes both good and evil, are merely the two feet it uses while traveling down a path of perfection.  With the good it finds solid ground on which it may place its weight, while with its bad it finds unsteady terrain unfit to support it and shifts weight back to the other appendage.  Both are equally useful in directing the path of human evolution and neither must be given more or less weight.  When it comes to human progress, we cannot overlook any means towards furthering the achievements of man.
		- [ ] p: If only I could believe and live your way of life; our purposes would be fulfilled.  But your philosophy is false.  You maintain that through struggle the greater force will rule and so perfection will be found.  Yet when the struggle is over, perfection will not be found.  It is in and of this reason that your belief, your philosophy, is unsustainable.  For in its intended end, it becomes contrary to its intent.  A philosophy may move and have being when exposed to external stimuli but it never changes its form; it merely follows the musculature as laid out by the architect.  Should it ever do so, it would become unfounded and inevitably fall
		- [ ] millie turned away
		- [ ] looking out over fields
		- [ ] m: we must do this
		- [ ] p: millie we can't
		- [ ] m: it's already in motion, the prophecy is being fulfilled, i am the iconodule, you're the iconoclast, and only one must remain
		- [ ] p: millie, please, millie
		- [ ] m: there will be no bloodshed after this final bloodsheet, i promise

		- [ ] already rifted away
		- [ ] appeared in tunnel
		- [ ] running throughout artificial planet
		- [ ] crestfallen
		- [ ] his friend was gone
		- [ ] not betrayed but corrupted

		- [ ] suited + prepared for battle
		- [ ] bernard read face
		- [ ] b: it's happened
		- [ ] peter nodded
		- [ ] b: so we make a stand
