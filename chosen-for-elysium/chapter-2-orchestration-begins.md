The autocephalate forces launched forward.  

Ships of the navy began swooping towards the planet surface while ground forces immediately began ferrying troops across the narrow gap. _Pangea_ was effectively a planet-sized troop transport bringing the fight to the doorsteap of the PROA.  

Autocephalate forces were immediately set upon by the defenders fleets. While the scale of the operation had been a surprise, the PROA were prepared for this contingency and boasted a greater military strength than the young confederacy. Despite a large portion of their resources spread away from their home territory, the defenses were still nearly double what the autocephalate forces could bring to bear.  

Peter would need to press the surprise advantage.  

Doyle appeared via hologram again. "Proctor, are you alright?" she asked hurriedly.  

"Yes, ma'am" replied Peter shaking his head to clear the bout of fatigue he felt after the rifting effort.  

Doyle looked at him pointedly. "Good" she said, clearly unconvinced but aware of the need to have him on the field. "Assume global orchestration for all battle groups as planned."  

"Yes, ma'am."  

Peter straightened and cracking knuckles he extended his arms again summoning a cloud of holograms around himself. He stood between the two great plates of _Pange_ and Earth as thousands of red and blue holographic points swarmed between them.  

Millie appeared opposite him and the two dove into their herculean task. The battle raged on for quite a while with the autocephalates making only gradual progress in pushing through the enemy's navy to land ground troops despite the coordination provided by the Proctor.  

Peter looked down through the glass floor as _Creature_ had oriented itself with its belly towards Earth in a relately secluded area of the battlefield.  

He calmly took in the scene below. Small starfighters darting between capital ships. Explosions throwing debris into competing gravities.  

A world of atoms controlled by his world of holographic bits.  

Millie came up next to him. "We have a problem."  

Peter turned his attention back to the holograms as Millie pulled up some data.  

"They were prepared for us."  

"What?"  

"Well, not this specific attack but an attack on the city." She zoomed in on the holographic image she had pulled up. "See that?"  

He leaned in scrutinizing the images before him. "It looks like an energy consumption chart."  

"Yeah, it's for Pyongyang and it skyrocketed in the weeks leading into their declaration while they were skirmishing with our forces."  

"...They brought their citiziens into the capital to act as human shields."  

Millie pointed at the chaos below them, "Every ship that drops from the sky is killing thousands."  

They'd have to force the conflict to the ground sooner than they had planned. In their plans, they knew that there would be some civilizn casualities but the capital city wasn't nearly as heavily populated as the sister city Seoul to the south. The attack was to force a surrender, not create a bloodbath.  

"We need to bring the battle to the ground immediately."  

"Agreed" responded Millie in a distracted voice.  

"Hey" said Peter pointedly "you with me?"  

"Yeah, yeah, it's just...astounding what humans are capable of. I've seen it all so many times since my activation it's still just...astounding."  

Peter looked at her worriedly. This was no time for his prime AI to become distant and lose focus from the battle at hand.  

"Which ship is Bernard's company located on?" he asked trying to cajole her back.  

Millie shook her head as if physically casting away her distractions. "She's onboard the _Great Paraklesis_. There, it doesn't look like they've been deployed yet."  

"Prepare a shuttle then go ahead to to draw up an attack pattern with them - we'll need some surgical strike teams to disrupt the ground defenses. I'll rendezvous with you there."  

A short while later, Peter was stepping through the airlock to board _Great Paraklesis_ fully armored for battle. He was met by Bernard, similarly armored and in the same calm but focused expression he knew so well.  

"Proctor."  

"Captain" he said as he saluted before shaking her hand.  

"The company is read. Millie informed us of our deployment instructions and helped formulate a plan for the attack. Other tactical units have been similarly prepared across the fleet and can drop as soon as you're ready."  

"Then we'll deploy right now."  

Bernard nodded before turning and walking into the ship tapping her earpiece.  

"Company, prepare to jump."  

They came to a tight hallway with exit portals bustling with activity of the soldiers preparing to enter the battle.  

Bernard stepped to the front with Peter following suit. Peter nodded to her and she tapped her earpiece again, "Captain, seal the boarding hallways."  

A moment later, doors behind the bristling company closed.  

"Helmets!" Bernard called out.  

Helmets were donned and sealed.  

"Doors!"  

Bay doors flew open.  

Wind instantly tore at them as their ship screamed through the atmosphere.  

"On my mark!" Bernard shouted over their headsets.  

"MARK!"  

Peter leapt into the air quickly followed by the rest of the soldiers and they all fell together through the aerial battle.  

They flew past dogfights and through exploding ships rapidly dropping closer and closer towards the city below. The increasingly dense atmosphere began to buffet them and land-based anti-aircraft became a sharp focus.  

In the last few moments of their flight, Peter noticed an old structure, built before the rise of the PROA. A symbol of oppression cast as a flame of hope.  

"_Creature_" he spoke into his headset "target that structure and bring it down" as he gestured with a holographic sight towards the tower.  

A moment later, streaks of bright light cut through the sky striking the base of the tower which immediately began to collapse. That was satisfying, Peter thought to himself.  

Just a few seconds later he and the rest of the company was on the ground, fighting furiously against the city defenders.  

Bernard was a blur.  

She was duel wielding blades but somehow didn't lose an ounce of force behind her strikes. Even as Peter lost himself to the battle, he never lost track of her in the melee.  

They pushed their way to one then two then three separate strongholds taking each in turn.  

Bernard turned to him in a brief moment of respite. "It sounds like we've located a power terminal that may be feeding multiple anti-aircraft batteries. We'll target that one next."  

Peter agreed but just as they were about to set off again, Millie appeared.  

"Peter you need to return to _Pangea_ immediately."  

"What? Why? We're in the middle of the campaign."  

"I know but I just received a message, to me directly. It's from an entirely unknown source but it's encoded using the earliest ITAM cryptographic hashes. You'll need to see this for yourself. Please, you have to come now!"  

A surprised Peter could only nod before summoning a gunship to bring him back.  

What could be so important he wondered.
