Peter, Bernard, and the company began to mobilze. It wouldn't take long before they were found. Peter's intercom crackled.  

"Proctor" came Captain Liu's voice "we've arrived and are engaging the enemy in the field near your location."  

"Good, we'll join you immediately."  

The group sped off down the hall with Bernard issuing orders as they ran. Squads peeled off as then went flying up exit tunnels to the surface.  

Finally it was just Peter and Bernard left. They both stopped at her exit, the penultimate for the group. Both nodded to each other.  

Again, Peter felt something else but before he could react, she shot up the tunnel to the surface.  

Peter spun and continued to his exit tunnel. Now it was all or nothing. Stop Icon here or not at all.  

The final hand had been dealt and only he and Millie were left at the table. Lewis, Belloc, and More were all gone. It was just the two of them left playing. All the chips were in the pot.  

When he arrived at his exit tunnel he stood at the bottom in silence.  

Resolve began to finally fill his body. If he fell he would at least have finally earned his rest. And that was good enough for him.  

He began to propell himself upwards summoning additional armor to his body as he prepared for battle. A sword materialized in his hand as the hatch above him opened momentarily blinding him with the bright sunlight. And then he was above ground taking in the scene before him.  

Armies were engaged in pitched battle on the once peaceful grassy hills. Iconist summoned by Restraint were fighting the ground forces supplied by _Courage Eternal_ which could be seen in the sky above engaging in ship-to-ship combat.  

Bernard and her company had charged in from the side unexpectedly temporarily throwing the newly arrived Iconist forces into disarray. And as usual, Bernard was at the heart of the fray, cutting a swath through the enemy in powerful, fluid motions.  

Peter leapt into the fray fighting with singular focus. Fighting, and fighting, and fighting.  

But no matter their resolve, their forces were hopelessly outnumbered and it was only a matter of time before they fell. Eventually he saw Millie's figure on the field, similarly engaged in savage combat with those around here. Bernard spotted her at the same time and shot across the field to engage.  

Peter was about to follow suit but Restraint landed on the ground between him and the now dueling pair. He stopped short as Restraint regarded him from across the short span separating them. Both raised their swords in salute and leapt toward one another.  

Their duel was like a brutal dance, the two moving in concert with their swords meeting with clangs and sparks to accentuate their steps.  

But Peter was superior.  

Years of war had honed his abilities and now they were on full display. Bit by bit he began to overcome the Pontifex until eventually he smashed the sword from her outstretched hand.  

He smashed the pommel of his weapon into her face stunning her briefly before gripping her wiht telekinetics and crushing her into the ground. Before she could escape he jumped into the air before diving to deliver a final downward stab.  

Restraint was dead.  

Peter withdrew the sword stood up looking around the field before his eyes fell on something he had never seen before.  

Bernard disarmed and standing with Millie's blade to her throat.

Stunned, Peter didn't know how to react. Bernard had never been defeated, ever. But she herself had told him long ago it was certainly possible and she had just yet met her match.  

Apparently, now she had.  

He raised his hand and a surrender order went out to all Autocephalate forces.  

"Don't" said Bernard, tears in her eyes.  

"Not for me."  

"We must now do what must be done" said Millie to Peter.  

Peter stood by helplessly as Iconist forces rounded up the troops on the field and brought them aboard _Courage Eternal_ as prisoners. The entire time, Millie kept her blade drawn on Bernard preventing Peter from doing a thing to stop her.  

_Courage Eternal_ lifted off into space now a part of the mobilizing Iconian fleet, preparing to lance out into the galaxy. The conquest of humanity had begun.  

"I'm sorry it had to be like this, Peter. But this sacrifice must be made, this last sacrifice."  

Peter had been silent this entire time. Starring out at the enormous fleet amassing before him, he was confronted with the enormity of his decision.  

He turned to look into Bernard's eyes. Then, in a split second, he realized what had to be done. And the sacrifice that had to be made.  

"I'm sorry, too" he said and flicked his wrist throwing Bernard backwards with a telekinetic push onto Millie's pointed blade.  

Her mouth opened in pain but not in surprise. She knew her life was forfeit the moment she lost to Millie and it was only Peter's reluctance to let her go that kept her alive.  

She knew that it had to be done.  

In the same motion a sword appeared in Peter's hand and he threw himself at Millie, with her sword entangled in Bernard's body. She launched herself backwards leaving the weapon behind as Bernard slumped to the floor.  

Peter placed himself between Millie and Bernard. She summoned another weapon and the Iconian guards surrounded the two figures.  

Just then the viewscreen erupted into flashes of light. An armada of Autocephalate ships appeared out of hyperspace before them.  

Peter's contingency had arrived.  

A hologram appeared on the bridge - it was Simon, Peter's predecessor.  

"Recognized, Peter Proctor of the Prophecy" said Simon in his low gravely voice.  

"Simon, execute the contingency."  

"Acknowledged."  

"All ships" said Peter his voice projecting across the fleet, "engage the enemy."  

And before anyone could speak, Peter let out a great roar of lightening throwing back the Iconian guards. With a wave of his hand, weapons appeared for the now guardless Bernard company.  

"Protect Bernard!" bellowed Peter.  

"What are you doing!" shrieked Millie who had withstood his blast.  

"Making the sacrifice" responded Peter rushing at her.  

The two began a viscious duel that took them around the command deck. Bernard's company collected her body and rushed out leaving the two locked in combat.  

Outside the viewscreen, the fleets had erupted in flames casting projectiles and lasers across space at one another. Below them the swarm surrounding the planet had begun to convulse and then begin diving towards the surface shredding it to pieces.  

"What have you done!?" screamed Millie.  

"It's all ancient ITAM technology, isn't it?" said Peter. "So is Simon."  

With a snarl, Millie turned and rushed back into the ship and down towards the hatch Peter and Bernard had used the day prior. She blasted the door open and threw herself out into space as her armor sealed around her.  

Peter followed and the two fell towards the planet below them. Yet another familiar situation, thought Peter in passing. The chase took them down between burning ships and exploding ordinance.  

Occasionally Peter would catch up and they would briefly engage on the hull of a passing frigate before continuing the descent. And once they reached the surface, the duel continued anew.  

Instead of the lush terrain that had welcomed him on his first arrival, he was now surrounding by burning fields and shredded landscapes - the work of Simon's hijacked drone swarms.  

A burning world of fire and ash.  

Their blades flew between them neither one making ground on the other.  

Slashes and perrys.  

Jabs and cuts.  

They were evenly matched having fought so long together side by side. But the Iconist prophecy was coming to fruition.  

Finally they paused as their blades met. They gazed through the blades at one another.  

"We can still stop this" grunted Millie.  

Peter shook his head. "You don't believe that."  

Millie shook her head as well. "I don't but it had to be said."  

They broke the lock and the duel continued.  

"Your right" said Peter threw blows "a sacrifice must be made."  

Millie's face was despondent but focused.  

"I know."  

Again the duel continued. Peter knew that neither wanted to kill the other. But both were willing to die to the stop the other.  

And now Peter accepted that.

Mid swing he brought his blade up in a light ready position. Without pause, Millie slashed the blade and drove it from his hand. He was defenseless but didn't move.  

Time seemed to slow down.  

In a split second, Millie recognized her advantaged position but did nothing. And in that moment of hesitation, Peter did something.  

A huge telekinetic blast threw Millie backwards smasher her against a boulder.  

In one smooth motion, Peter propelled himself across the space between them summoning another blade.  

And in an instance, he drove it through her chest and into the rock behind her.  

Millie gasped in shock.  

After a pause, Peter disintegrated the blade and stepping forward he gently caught her as she fell forward unpined from the stone. Blood oozed from her mouth.  

"But...Peter..."  

"I know."  

"The...sacrifice."  

"I know."  

"I'm...sorry...so...sorry..."  

"I know."  

"Peter..."  

And with a final breath, Millie died. The great AI turned human and Peter's last friend.  

Icon, the world of promise, continued to erupt in a final destruction around him. Tears finally fell from his eyes as he held the body of his friend to his chest.  

The cacophony crescendoed around him.  

A rushing explosion.  

And then nothing.

_Epilogue_  

With Peter's sacrifice the Icon contingency was quelled before it could begin. Simon's timely arrival with the fleet and the destruction of the homeworld put a permanent end to the Iconian project. Bernard recovered from her injuries and with Millie and Symbiotic Restraint defeated, the Iconist prophecy was fulfilled.  

But in the reverse of what they had believed. Millie was the Iconoclast and Peter was the Iconodule. Millie's actions led to Icon's destruction while Peter had fought to save it.  

And while one was chosen for Elysium, the other was chosen to remain.  

And that too was fulfilled.  

Because through scouring the ruins of Icon, the Autocephalates came across a cold storage unit, one capable of holding a great deal of digital data. Perhaps even enough for a being who had bridged the gap between worlds digital and physical.  

A _homo syntheticus_.
