Through the steady flurry of activity stepped a man in uniform - similar to Doyle's but with a slightly different style. "Admiral" said Doyle as she saluted. His harsh, weathered face and furrowed, bushy imposing eyebrows broke into a smile.

"Ah, General Doyle, welcome" he said as he reciprocated her salute before shaking hands.

"Allow me to introduce the Proctor."

"Welcome, Proctor, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance" said the admiral straightening his back and delivering a small nod. "I am Vice Admiral Eustace George, Commander of the 6th Fleet of _Jupiter_."

"He has agreed to join us" said Doyle in a low voice.

Peter noticed that George's face had tightened slightly at his introduction and it wasn't a surprise as to why - he knew the admiral's file. He had sided with More and Belloc in the Thirty-Minute War which certainly called into question his loyalty now.

"I'm glad to hear it" responded the admiral with an _almost_ imperceptible pause.

Doyle continued without noticing "I'd like the opportunity to provide a full, multi-branch briefing to the Proctor as soon as possible, but for now I wanted to make his presence known and to begin integrating him into our operations."
