Sunrise greeted the group as they awoke and went about a quick breakfast. After gathering a few things for the trip the two humans and their two artificial companions boarded the skiff and set off for Port Sendler. It was more small and compact, rather functionally industrial in its layout, but served its purpose well. Not that it mattered as there was little time for sightseeing.

They boarded their ship and were off for the Federation lunar base which had been heavily terraformed since Peter's last visit. It had only been a few months since his last departure from _Pangea_, when he had gone to inspect a project with Lewis, but its scale still amazed him when he could get a global view himself. The entire outer shell of the construct had been completely terraformed providing the basic framework for natural life to flourish.

Much still needed to be refined and populated, but the essentials were there. A new world waiting to be discovered.

The flight to the lunar base was short and Peter spent the time alone with his thoughts on the observation deck. Maybe not in thought, but thinking about nothing.

A great sliver of grey-white appeared before the ship as the half-shadowed lunar body came closer. Surrounding the visible landscape was a faintly glowing blue halo - the first indicator that this was no longer the ancient, silent moon of generations past. Substantial coordinated efforts by dozens of organizations, including the Federation of Pangea, had undertaken the massive task of terraforming the Earth's closest neighbor. The project had begun immediately prior to Peter's ascent to the Proctorship and it had made great strides in creating a habitable atmosphere and terrain for the _homo sapiens_ looking to make it a second home.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder, voicing his silent thoughts. "They've made incredible progress" she said, pointing out towards the landscape, "there's still much more that can be seeded with fauna. It's not the same problem they had building _Pangea_; in some respects, this one seems harder since it's a framework we didn't create ourselves."

The ship dove towards the moon, zeroing in on one of the many installations scattered across the surface. Some cities appeared to be industrial operations while others looked more like farming or trading posts; all bore similar, sleek metallic designs befitting their extraterrestrial location. Towers rose up, more narrow than those on Earth due to the gravity manipulations on the lunar surface.

They swooped down towards a large collection of low buildings embedded into the ground and dropped into a sunken docking bay. The base had a practical feel but still maintained a sleek and beautiful exterior in common with the rest of the lunar buildings. Pivoting on its tail, their ship gracefully slid into a floating dock part of a circular port containing a variety of other large vessels.

As their party disembarked to the walkway surrounding the dock, armed personnel could be seen monitoring checkpoints and inspecting incoming ships. "We're not on _Pangea_ anymore" whispered Millie's voice in Peter's ear.

They followed Doyle out into a paved courtyard surrounded by small, well-kept sloping green lawns and into an adjacent building. Down hallways and through several checkpoints, they eventually came to what was clearly a war room. Large holograms displaying maps and figures were everywhere and glowing tables displayed fleets and weaponry. Individuals moved about dressed in military uniforms or full combat load out. Robots were similarly outfitted in martial attire; even the holographic AI wore armor.

"Do you think they're planning anything?" asked Millie sarcastically.

Through the steady flurry of activity stepped a man in uniform - similar to Doyle's but with a slightly different style. "Admiral" said Doyle as she saluted. His harsh, weathered face and furrowed, bushy imposing eyebrows broke into a smile.

"Ah, General Doyle, welcome" he said as he reciprocated her salute before shaking hands.

"Allow me to introduce the Proctor."

"Welcome, Proctor, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance" said the admiral straightening his back and delivering a small nod. "I am Vice Admiral Eustace George, Commander of the 6th Fleet of _Jupiter_."

"He has agreed to join us" said Doyle in a low voice.

Peter noticed that George's face had tightened slightly at his introduction and it wasn't a surprise as to why - he knew the admiral's file. He had sided with More and Belloc in the Thirty-Minute War which certainly called into question his loyalty now.

"I'm glad to hear it" responded the admiral with an _almost_ imperceptible pause.

Doyle continued without noticing "I'd like the opportunity to provide a full, multi-branch briefing to the Proctor as soon as possible, but for now I wanted to make his presence known and to begin integrating him into our operations."

George nodded and turned to begin issuing orders to his adjuncts. Doyle's subordinates also dispersed about their duties.

"I also wanted to introduce your combat unit assignment. Should conflict arise, you will likely need a field placement. We've put you with one of our more lightweight armored divisions that handles a flexible range of mission types."

She signaled to an officer standing quietly off to the side of the room.

"This is Captain Nicoletta Bernard, commander of Scipio Company."

Bernard stepped forward. She had a sight build and her brown hair was pulled back into a messy bun; she couldn't be much older than Peter. Her partially equipped armor suit and sword hilt were battle-worn and the red scarf around her neck was heavily frayed at the edges. Clearly she had seen a great deal of action.

Her solemn, expressionless countenance gave nothing away to Peter.

"Bernard is a highly decorated soldier, according to her file" whispered Millie in his ear. "One of the most powerful combatants in the field, apparently. Brilliant tactician and leader. Most of her missions are open-ended and require a great deal of adaptability and ingenuity."

Her self-assured but unassuming stance was one of a warrior and a force to be reckoned with.

The two exchanged nods.

"You'll be attached to Bernard's unit under her command initially as a lieutenant. You'll be undergoing her squad's training and should we see action, you will be following her orders in broader strategy with the plan of elevating you to Arch Captain of the unit which will remain under her tactical command and your strategic initiatives."

Doyle turned to face Peter.

"You are still Proctor and after your initial training and martial exposure will be assuming broader directorial involvement and autonomy utilizing the privileges of the Proctor rank."

"Understood?"

It was an acceptable arrangement - one where Peter could "get his feet wet" in preparation for the militaristic role he would potentially have to regrettable shoulder. While the outcome was an uncomfortable one, the approach in delivering it was reasonable.

"Yes, ma'am."

The general's face showed that she was relieved and pleased that with his response.

"Excellent."

After these initial introductions came a series of presentations and discussions outlining preparations for mobilizing the forces necessary to counteract the potential enemy. While intelligence pointed at a growing threat, it still presented the great unknown as to who the enemy might actually be and from where they would strike. Eventually, they were dismissed and Peter followed Bernard back to her company barracks.

Bernard was silent along the walk and although Peter had grown comfortable with it in his long self-imposed exile, he somehow felt out of his element around the captain.

"What do you, uh, do, captain?" came his question, awkwardly stumbling in to break their silence.

"I command Scipio Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th Mechanized Regiment - a special purpose unit with a smaller headcount than a typical company at forty-six members."

"Uh, oh...yeah."

It was a matter-of-fact answer but it was still just as awkward for Peter to listen to as his own question that prompted the response.

"Smooth" whispered Millie in his ear. Peter didn't ask anymore questions.

The pair arrived at a side hanger and were greeted by a sight new to Peter. Before them were dozens of large, bipedal mechanical figures standing approximately twenty feet high. All bore armor plating along their major limbs - rounded, close-fitting pauldrons, circular neck guards, broad chest plates. Tight bunches of tubes formed sinews surrounding smooth ball joints evoking biological imagery. A small head protruded forward from a large divot in the chest with three small, ovular eyes peering outward.

Even with their armor plating, they looked quick and nimble enough to carry themselves swiftly through whatever combat zone they were clearly destined for.

"Pretty cool, huh?" spoke up Millie in his ear. "These are some of the mechanized weaponry available to the ITAM ground forces. They're easily outfitted with additional weapons" she continued as she appeared next to Peter and waved in the direction of several large boxes surrounded by hand-held and hull-integrated weapons.

Peter and Bernard walked down the loosely ordered rows of the mechs which appeared to be split into several groupings.

"We call them "Bigs" said Bernard, gesturing to the mechs, "and we, their counterparts, are "Smalls". In action we combine the two modes of combat to ensure versatility throughout the course of a mission."

They arrived at a unit which appeared to be untouched and bore none of the wear-and-tear the others had. Bernard motioned him forward. He did so, looking upwards into the face of the squatting giant.

Its eyes lit up and instantly trained on Peter's face. The mech leaned forward onto its knuckles as Peter stepped back in surprise. A deep, gravely voice rumbled from the machine, "Identified: Lieutenant First Class Peter. Assigned to: Unit 14-99, _Rommel_-Class Mechanized Battle Armor. Begin personalized piloting configuration setup program."

Its head and chest plate unsealed and swung open to reveal an interior command cabin within the main body. Kneeling down on one knee, a short set of ladder rungs sprung from the upright shin leading into the chest. Bernard nodded encouragement to Peter's questioning look.

He clambered up the mech and into the tight cockpit; a partial standing chair with miniature embedded gravity points held the pilot in place while wiry braces held shin and forearm pedals allowing for greater control of the suit while providing haptic feedback. Hologram emitters were scattered throughout providing a wide view of the field. Peter climbed into the seat and at the touch of a few buttons, the display emitters swirled to life.

A gentle tornado of holographic bits appeared next to him before coalescing into a bust of Millie.

"Hello there" she said by way of greeting.

"What are you doing in the mech?" he asked.

"Serving as your Big-Small interface. That job is typically assigned to a lesser AI but I have orders to replace it. I'm gonna have to get used to watching where I step - you're so much smaller than me now."

"I so appreciate your sacrifice" he replied sarcastically.

"Don't mention it. Go ahead and run the auto setup program and the practice operations to get a better feel for this thing." She dispersed into fragments and Peter turned back to the holographic controls.

At his command, the Big straightened up and the chest hatched sealed him inside. All of the visual holograms snapped on immediately providing a 180 degree image of the hanger.

Placing his arms and legs into the braces, he let the machinery automatically click into place around his digits and extremities. He could feel resistance as he began to move his arms about - probably an intentional design to provide a scaled sense of the Big's actual movement capabilities which allowed the pilot to make the machine a true extension of their own body. His hands came up before his face and through the hologram he could see the titans hands mirror his own. Little human fingers wiggled and giant metal fingers wiggled in unison.

Leaning forward slightly he could see his slightly stockier robot legs firmly planted below him. Shifting weight back and forth, he could feel the foot pedals adjusting their resistance.

This is so cool.

After some additional physical exploration and after completing the setup program, he shut the mech down which settled back into its previous hunched position to let him egress. Bernard approached him.

"Training will officially begin tomorrow. Unfortunately, it will be something of a "crash course" given our constrained schedule and you'll be provided with the bare minimum necessary in order for you to effectively follow commands and work with the unit. We're not intending on placing you on the front lines but we want to be prepared for every contingency."

With that she led him to the barracks which were more like dormitories with each room housing four bunks and lockers what few amenities the teammates might have. Along the back wall of each was a long, shared computer terminal for work and planning. The three other occupants of the room jumped to the floor and stood as Bernard entered the room - not at full attention, at ease. It was clear that she commanded a strong and earned respect from her subordinates.

"Your squad mates will be responsible for teaching you the daily regimen and schedule required of a lieutenant." Peter got the sense that Scipio company as a whole had been imbued with Bernard's focus and strength.

A blinking alert pinged on Bernard's wrist. Holding her arm forward she tapped a button and a hologram of Doyle appeared.

"Return to the war room immediately. Bring Lieutenant Peter."

Bernard and Peter shared a look and quickly left the room in a jog.

Something in the tone of Doyle's voice was off - strained. When they arrived, the entire room was silently standing, circled around the main table with a figure projected above it.

It was Lewis.

His passive face frozen before them. Millie materialized over Peter's shoulder with a look of concern on her face. Doyle and George turned as they entered; the general ushered Peter forward towards the table.

"We received this message but it requires the approval of the Proctor in order to play it."

Peter waved his hand over the table uneasily. The image flickered as playback began.

"ITAM & Co. has strayed from his mission and has become an undermining threat towards the success of humanity. In order to avoid imminent stagnation of ITAM & Co. and the resulting collapse of the firm's mission unfortunate but necessary action must now be taken."

"As a result, I am announcing my resignation from all roles held within the firm and denounce ITAM & Co.'s leadership currently usurped by the Federation of Pangea. An external project has been organized to bring the firm back into alignment with its founding intentions. I will do what is necessary to bring about what is right."

The hologram flicked off and silence filled the empty space left by the former chairman.

"The rumors were true" murmured George to himself.

"Now we know for sure what it is we're up against" responded Doyle.

George retorted "And now we know that we haven't prepared enough."

Silence fell again as all those in the room knew the enormity of what they were now up against. The most powerful member of the Federation had just declared open rebellion.

Peter's heart sank. He knew that everyone in the room realized that Lewis was not only a powerful leader but the mentor to the most powerful asset that they had - himself. They were up against someone who knew Peter better than he knew himself.

He had become a liability.
