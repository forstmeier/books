"Approaching targets" came a voice over the intercom.

The two were quickly joined by the rest of the squad who donned their helmets and prepared their weapons. Just a few minutes later came the first rounds of anti-aircraft fire.

Gunboat doors swung open and Peter and his squad leapt from the flying vehicle and rocketed down upon their target. Without pausing Peter began "smoking" and hurled himself down into and along a defensive trench the enemy had constructed, cutting down every defender in his path.

Landing on the edge, he whipped his sword through the torso of a soldier before firing a rocket down into a bunker below him in the trench. Fire and smoke shot out along with the cries of its inhabitants. He turned and stalked towards a small group of infantrymen rushing down on him.

Bloodlust rose again in his head and dropping his helmet, let out a roar of anger as he sprinted forward. Blood and dirt flew around them as they dueled furiously. One by one they fell, and the last Peter grabbed by the throat as he gutted her.

He looked into the woman's eyes as the life left her body before throwing her into the mud at his feet. He felt nothing but anger.

"They've taken the fortress" spoke Millie softly in his ear - she had given up trying to curb his destruction. "...And Arthur."

Peter stiffened. Without saying a word, he engaged his boosters and shot off across the still-active battlefield towards the fortress in the distance.
