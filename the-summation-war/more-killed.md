He felt his arm spin away cut cleanly just below the elbow but he didn't flinch. He continued focusing on the ship steadily moving it towards an empty square that it could be put down in.

Even now, More couldn't kill him outright, at least not immediately. Perhaps there was some good left in her after all. But she would still see the job done, even if it pained her greatly.

She drew her blade back again, this time prepared to deliver the final blow.

A quick flash of red flew by a blade met More's causing her to spin away to recover her balance.

There stood Bernard clad in armor and a war kilt - she raised her blade in salute before smoothly running forward to engage More. The now-maimed Peter continued directing the falling ship but could see the two women battling out of the corner of his eye.

More was fighting fiercely with a savage look in her eyes. Bernard was calm as ever but moved with great intent and agency - she would end her opponent here and now. The two dueled ferociously but More was quickly losing ground.

Swiftly, Bernard sidestepped a strike and spun bringing her blade down hard on More's blade driving it from her hand. Without stopping she spun and drove her sword clean through More's torso.

More gasped in shock as she felt the mortal blow strike home. Bernard quickly withdrew the blade and stepped away from her defeated opponent. Instinctively, More's hand went to her wound before falling to her knees and rolling onto her side.

Peter finally managed to set the ship down and quickly went to More's side. He rolled her onto his knees and cradled her head in his hands.

"No...no...no..." whispered More feverishly.

"Shhhhh, don't. Just rest. Don't worry."

"I...need to...go..." She closed her eyes and died. Peter bowed his head at the loss of life, the woman who had once loved him dearly and who he still loved like family.
