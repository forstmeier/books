_Epilogue_

Before he collapsed from fatigue, Peter was able to connect Millie with the opposition's central system and she successfully seized control over the broad majority of equipment and resources ending the battle and effectively ending the war. Several holdouts remained across Earth and several off-Earth colonies had managed to solidify their holdings following the uprising but their influence was contained.

Lewis's ploy had been successful in pulling to the top the most dangerous factions of the world and defeating the vast majority of them in one fell swoop. However, this information was never made public, and Lewis's actions were widely condemned by the world community.

Peter, in his role as Proctor over the reunited ITAM, began setting about to dismantle the sphere of influence of the organization and instead focus on building a true landless nation named the Republic of Reliquia. With this new status, the Reliquian nation began focusing on establishing independent, collaborative projects with other nations and entities rather than dictating large-scale operations.

Jerusalem had been all but entirely destroyed in the final major engagement of the war with an astounding loss of life from all parties involved with More's deadman switch being the primary culprit in this regard. Peter's final actions in rifting the city managed to save most lives there and Millie had guided all of the rifted resources to _Pangea_ somewhat intact. While many historic resources were returned to Jerusalem after the war, some were kept on _Pangea_ to truly become a "kingdom of the heavens."

Another recording from Lewis was later discovered by Millie in his private journals. It read:

"We are still in the era of enemies but one day perhaps we will be brothers all. Until then, we will need someone to find the demons in our midst and I do not ask for a pardon for what I have done. These atrocities and unforgivable acts I have committed were done because they were what was needed, not what was right."

"Greater humanity needed this from me: my own humanity. No one should make this decision again and I hope that you all go on to be better."
