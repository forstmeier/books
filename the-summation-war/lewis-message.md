Bernard and Peter shared a look and quickly left the room in a jog.

Something in the tone of Doyle's voice was off - strained. When they arrived, the entire room was silently standing, circled around the main table with a figure projected above it.

It was Lewis.

His passive face frozen before them. Millie materialized over Peter's shoulder with a look of concern on her face. Doyle and George turned as they entered; the general ushered Peter forward towards the table.

"We received this message but it requires the approval of the Proctor in order to play it."

Peter waved his hand over the table uneasily. The image flickered as playback began.

"ITAM & Co. has strayed from his mission and has become an undermining threat towards the success of humanity. In order to avoid imminent stagnation of ITAM & Co. and the resulting collapse of the firm's mission unfortunate but necessary action must now be taken."

"As a result, I am announcing my resignation from all roles held within the firm and denounce ITAM & Co.'s leadership currently usurped by the Federation of Pangea. An external project has been organized to bring the firm back into alignment with its founding intentions. I will do what is necessary to bring about what is right."

The hologram flicked off and silence filled the empty space left by the former chairman.

"The rumors were true" murmured George to himself.

"Now we know for sure what it is we're up against" responded Doyle.

George retorted "And now we know that we haven't prepared enough."

Silence fell again as all those in the room knew the enormity of what they were now up against. The most powerful member of the Federation had just declared open rebellion.

Peter's heart sank. He knew that everyone in the room realized that Lewis was not only a powerful leader but the mentor to the most powerful asset that they had - himself. They were up against someone who knew Peter better than he knew himself.

He had become a liability.
