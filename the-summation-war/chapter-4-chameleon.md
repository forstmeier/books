Sirens blared out and the control room burst into chaos.

"Assembly the company in the hanger" barked Bernard.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder; "On it" she confirmed quickly before disappearing again. "Let's go" and the two sprinted out and down the hallways. From outside, muffled explosions and weapons fire could be heard.

Bursting into the hanger, they could see the rest of the company rapidly suiting up. He ran over and quickly donned his armor suit before scrambling into his Big and securing the cockpit around him.

Bernard's voice crackled through the shared team communications channel. "We have intel coming in regarding the attacking force. It consists of several heavy cruisers but they've chosen to primarily deploy ground forces against the base. Several regiments of infantry with heavy mechanized support and a cluster of artillery divisions. From the looks of it, they're here to seize the base rather than destroy it outright."

To Peter what that meant is that they were here for him, to capture him.

"We're going to hit them fast and hard, specifically we'll target their heavy weaponry and put the vanguard on its heels. Platoon 1, that's you with me."

"Yes ma'am" said Peter.

"Platoons 2 and 3, you'll be providing a triage defense to allow our ground forces to establish their own defenses."

"Yes, ma'am" came the affirmative over the intercom.

While she spoke, the company had been deploying itself - mechs and accompanying soldiers launched from the hanger to engage the enemy. Gunboats and soldiers were descending on the outskirts of the base through the defensive artillery fire. Without breaking pace in her speeding mech, Bernard barked out orders.

"Alpha Squad, take left and draw fire. Beta and Gamma, move right and focus on containment. Delta - with me up the middle to outward pincer into the flanks. Go!"

"Yes, ma'am!" and the platoon split on their respective assignments.

Two enemy mechs, of a similar size and build, dropped down in front of the running squad and opened fire. Bernard fired back as she moved forward, jumping and propelling herself over a building to the left - surprising both the oncoming mechs and the enemies she immediately engaged on the other side out of Peter's line of site.

Peter and the remaining squad dispersed while exchanging fire in an effort to flank the oncoming combatants. An explosion erupted from where Bernard had disappeared to. Her Big came flying back over the building, partially throw by the explosion. In one smooth motion she body kicked one out into the squad's field of fire to be quickly cut down before pivoting and launching a heavy grenade, point blank, into the other's command cabin.

"Keep going" Bernard ordered as she stepped over the fallen carcass. The team pressed forward, engaging the oncoming waves of the assault. Two squad members had left their damaged but functional Bigs on autonomous mode, and were now riding on the back of Peter's own mech.

Together the squad managed to establish a beachhead against the invading units dropping in. While the outer sections of the base had fallen, they were able to begin mounting a defense of the interior, centering around headquarters.

The rhythm of true battle was something Peter had never experienced before. Training and dueling had prepared him somewhat, but a full-scale battle was totally new. In some ways it was even exhilarating, engaging the enemy one-on-one. Almost intoxicating.

"Naval reinforcements" came Millie's voice through his headset. He looked up and not far above them in the atmosphere were two battleships which quickly began trading blasts with the enemy cruisers. It was the turning point they needed.

The enemy offensive quickly turned into a fighting retreat as they made they way to the transport ships and hurriedly lifted off in the direction of the cruisers. Bernard ordered the company to stand down; pursuing the attackers was now in the hands of the battleships and their fighter contingents. Those cruisers that had survived the battleships' onslaught made emergency jumps into hyperspace, stranding a handful of assault forces who were quickly rounded up and captured.

About an hour later, Peter and Bernard, stripped off their equipment and reconvened at the command center. George greeted them with a frown.

"The situation has escalated quickly" he spoked in a hushed voice as he ushered them towards the viewscreens along the wall.

They were streaming information - news headlines and reports. Skimming through them quickly, Peter could see what the admiral had meant.

"There have been massive upheavals planet-side" confirmed George. "Particularly across central and western Asia as well as flare ups across eastern Europe, and pieces of northern Africa."

Doyle stepped in. "It looks like a widespread, coordinated, but not officially connected, series of political factions rising to power through coups and putsches."

"They're definitely coordinated" growled George in agreement.

"At the very least" continued Doyle, "they've clearly been simultaneously executed but we still have no clear confirmation that they're working together in any specific capacity. They were certainly triggered in union."

"This has got to be Lewis at work" said George with his hands on the table before them. "Western Asia and the middle east seem to be of the most intense focus given the regional historic schisms and rivalries."

"Several major alliances were all announced in the past hour" interjected Millie. "Some are even crossing traditional ethno-religious boundaries."

George muttered "These are dozens of pieces falling into place for what seems to be the same puzzle - could he be creating an uber-organization made up of all of these disparate entities? Something to challenge the Federation?"

The group continued discussing unfolding situation and observing the reports as they came in. It soon became apparent that separatist forces had played a direct role in several of the power grabs; the separatist factions under Lewis were the connection, the spark, behind and a part of the entire unfolding cataclysm. Some of the newly established governments launched assaults on their neighbors and the face of the planet became engulfed in war.

But within that chaos, a pattern was beginning to emerge. Coalitions, alliances, overthrows, conflicts, and conquests, all falling into place like dominoes. George's concern was validated. Indirectly or directly, Lewis was becoming the center of a global superpower.

And then it came.

The splinter faction of the Federation reformed itself as the Administrative Union and immediately following this was an announcement from its newly-formed Office of the Secretary with Lewis holding the Secretary's position. While the violence and conflict was softly condemned, it was regarded as a necessary action to unify the world under a new coalition government with the Union serving as its de facto head. As part of the required steps for stabilization, all rival and unbending factions would be brought to heel by force if necessary.

It was now clear to the observers in the command center that moves against the Federation early on were intended to destabilize one of the major obstacles towards achieving this goal. After the announcement, reports came in of several major defections occurring among the loyalists' ranks. Loyalists were bristling and skirmishes broke out as defectors attempted to make off with resources and weapons.

Lines were rapidly being drawn and the loyalists were already badly outgunned. War was now upon them.

Peter summoned Arthur.

"You called for me, sir."

"Yes, Arthur. What have you found so far in your search for information moles?"

"Unfortunately, nothing conclusive as of yet, sir. There are many potential infractions but no definitive breaches. I have compiled a list of suspicious activities but none of them are actionable as of yet."

He turned and tapped several commands into a console and the hologram began displaying scrolling rolls of data.

"Here's the list of channels that I have investigated."

The group began reading through the data as it moved past and discussed courses of action. Peter was disappointed that nothing concrete had been unearthed by Arthur's examination. It was every channel, every communication.

Suddenly, a dark thought flew through Peter's mind. His stomach went cold. Stepping forward, he tapped the command console and the data on the screen began to shift.

The others stopped their conversation and turned to watch. Every one of the scrolling rows quickly filtered away. Peter typed in a few more commands.

A single channel appeared.

"What is this?" asked George.

"It's the channels that have not been evaluated" answered Bernard.

"There's only one. It's Arthur's" said Peter softly.

Peter tapped a few more commands with his Proctor-level authorization and thousands of lines began flowing across the screen. Each was a message and every message had the same destination. The group turned to look at Arthur; Millie materialized over the table with a look of incredulity on her face.

"You were communicating with Lewis" she breathed.

"Arthur...?"

"I am sorry, sir" said the robot, turning to face Peter.

"It was you."

"Yes, sir. I was following orders and acting under the auspices of ITAM & Co."

"We trusted you - I trusted you. And you betrayed us to Lewis."

"I hope that you will understand my actions one day, sir."

A misty smoke appeared and quickly enveloped the robot and in an instant he disappeared, rifting away.

A blade slashed through the air where the robot had stood a half a second before. Bernard had shot forward attempting to bring him down but he had vanished before she could.

There was a loud boom outside.

"Shit!" shouted Millie. "I'll go after him!" and she disappeared.

"What the hell was that?" bellowed George.

"He's escaping!" shouted Doyle. "Track him! He can't have gone far."

A soldier shouted from the other side of the room "Sir, a sloop just dropped out of hyperspace at surface level."

It was the getaway vehicle risking a dangerous low-level hyperspace exit in order to retrieve Arthur. There must have been some pre-arranged escape in order to time it so perfectly with Arthur's rift.

"All battleships, open fire on that sloop!" George ordered.

"They can't do that" said Bernard "the base is in the line of fire."

"Dammit!"

There was another boom outside as the sloop jumped back into hyperspace.

"The sloop is gone, sir"

"Dammit!"

"Look" said Doyle, pointing towards the center table.

There stood another glowing hologram of Lewis. Millie reappeared shaking her head, unsuccessful in her attempt to stop Arthur's escape. Peter walked to the center of the room in a daze and activated the message.

"Human history is littered with violence and this is proving to be yet another chapter in that ever-growing book. This chapter has been written for the Proctor and brings great danger to the broader humanity which that office was tasked with defending." Whatever must be done in the coming conflict will be done to ensure victory of Man. Whatever you use to defend yourself, I will use to break you. Whatever you take as your strength, I will cripple you with it. Hope, courage, faith will all fail you."

The hologram snapped off and the room erupted into hubbub but Peter couldn't hear any of it over the ringing in his own ears. All he could think of was Arthur. This was more than a betrayal. His oldest friend was lost.

Had he ever really been his friend?
