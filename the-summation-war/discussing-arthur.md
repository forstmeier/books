A chill ran down Peter's spine. Hitting back and capturing Arthur, the one who had betrayed them all, would be a just and valuable counter action. The commanders looked at him intently for his response.

"It's a major base" said the admiral "and it's heavily fortified. A large garrison appears to be stationed there and it would take a concerted effort for our forces to take it down. There's also no guarantee that Arthur wouldn't immediately move off of that target once he was aware of what we were planning."

"No, he'll be there" said Peter shaking his head. "He'll follow his orders and he'll stay until he's ordered to leave."

Doyle's face showed concern. "He's a valuable asset yes, but is it worth risking a large percentage of our available forces in order to bring him down?" She paused uncertainly. "Perhaps, if we evaluate the situation with clearer heads-"

"It doesn't matter what I feel" interrupted Peter. "We just need to kill him."

A silence fell on the table. While Doyle looked uneasy, George seemed pleased with the decision. Bernard was implacable as always, as she gazed intently at Peter. He looked away in annoyance - she knew him too well at this point and knew he was on a full tilt.

Millie popped up. "I agree with Peter: we should move immediately on that post. It will give us an opportunity to both seize a valuable strategic position that compromises the enemy's mobility while also removing a major player from the board. This makes sense."

Doyle's face was still set in a frown. "I don't disagree, but are we thinking in purely strategic terms here?" Clearly, she was concerned over Peter's state of mind in coming to this decision.

"It doesn't matter - it's the end result that we need."

That ended the discussion and conversation quickly turned to planning the actual operation. What they arrived at was a ruse where their position and two other major conflict points would engage in a choreographed retreat to pool resources and launch a single offensive on the fortress.

Throughout the discussions, Doyle continued to object to the all-or-nothing approach insisting that it was too high a risk given their current predicament but was overruled each time as Peter would invoke his position as Proctor. However, Peter also eventually conceded that it would be more prudent to capture Arthur than to kill him as he would be valuable intelligence resource. He could tell by the way they were looking at him throughout the discussions that he was acting strangely - it made him even angrier but he tried not to show it.

Early the next morning, the weather was heavily overcast which perpetuated the general sense of gloom. Orders were issue and assets were mobilized.

The plan was on.
