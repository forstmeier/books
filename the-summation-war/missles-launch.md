Peter opened a channel to all ship commanders. "Prepare to fire missiles on my mark." They would punch their way through.

"Open hatch!" he ordered to the gunboat crew. It swung open and Peter had to brace himself against the rushing wind. Stepping to the door he paused for a brief moment before jumping out into thin air. Activating his jetpack, he moved out ahead of the charging gunboat.

"All ships, fire!"

Behind him, the entire fleet fired their missiles simultaneously across at their enemies. They were still too far to make the missiles particularly effective as they could mostly be intercepted before reaching their desired targets - so Peter needed to get them closer. Reaching out, he could feel Millie helping him to focus and expand his power. He began to partially rift, leaving a trail of smoke, as he flew through the atmosphere.

In a split second, he expanded the points of the rift to encompass each of the flying missiles. And then, in rapid succession, they materialized around him in a rushing storm of fire like a flock of thundering phoenixes. The enemy couldn't have predicted this and were now vulnerable to the focused swarm of destruction.

At the last moment, Peter threw the missiles ahead forming a vortex around him just before they slammed into the enemy. Capital ships were torn apart and consumed in enormous fireballs before their hulking wrecks fell from the sky. The ploy had worked and a crack had been made in the enemy's lines which they could wedge their attack through.
