"You're hurt" said Bernard from behind him. Peter looked down at the stump where his hand used to be.

"We need to go."

Peter nodded in agreement as Bernard stepped forward to help guide him off. Suddenly a series of explosions blew apart houses nearby. They looked up to see opposition capital ships beginning to open fire on the city and surrounding ships indiscriminately. A smaller ship veered downwards and slammed into the skyline.

Millie appeared and consulting scrolling data in front of her she said "More activated a deadman switch. It activated an override program on all opposition weaponry and vehicles. From the looks of it, it's designed to have all forces encircle the city and destroy everything in it including themselves."

Peter gazed upwards - the pitch of the battle above had become much more destructive - fire and carnage was everywhere. The city of heaven surrounded by hell.

"No." His companions looked at him. "We won't let that happen."

Millie turned back to the scrolling data before her searching the networks for information.

"Got it." She threw a map up for the others to see. "We can piggyback onto her override and seize control of their equipment, ending the self-destruct and the battle itself. We need to get to the headquarters, here" she said pointing to the map where a little red dot had appeared. "I would be able to connect into the system from that central location."

"Okay. Let's go."
