Rapid preparations followed for the coming engagement which would take the form of an all-out assault on Jerusalem, the now de facto head of the insurgency operations.

Peter suited himself in a full set of heavier armor all white and gray with several small wing-like appendages from its upper arms and back. The call went out to all forces to abandon posts and make a final slicing run at the opposition leadership position. Cut off the head of the serpent.

Loyalist ships convened in low orbit as the enemy ships similarly positioned themselves defensively around the outskirts of Jerusalem. There was a bustle of activity on the ship's bridge as Peter looked on. This would be a one final run to bring down the enemy - do or die.

The charge brought the loyalist forces to rapidly close the gap with the enemy. And then it began.

Ships began firing across the dwindling gap at one another. The bridge shook as they came under fire. Peter looked out at the blue sky around them and the world down below as the two fleets ignited above it all.

He left the bridge and quickly loaded into a gunboat alongside others who would be serving as a forward shock trooper entry. They dropped from the belly of the capital ship and shot out across the expanse between the fleets - other ships could be seen doing the same. It was imperative that they take this battle to the ground wherever the leadership, More, was.
