He was sitting in his tent his with his hands hanging between his knees staring at nothing and trying not to focus on anything when the flap opened and Bernard entered. She was just as tired and worn - her company had sustained terrible loses leading many of the most daring counter attacks, but she continued to push on.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder at the same time.

"We've found something."

Peter rubbed his eyes. "What is it?" he said, dully.

"We can't talk here, follow me."

He followed her out into the darkness - it was well after midnight and for once there were no sounds of active combat nearby.

Bernard kept walking, straight out from the camp defensive lines. She ignited her boosters and took off; Peter followed suit. After a short while, they arrived at a large, round stone protruding from the ground with Doyle standing on top of it awaiting their arrival.

"We have a problem" said Doyle as they alighted next to her. "Millie intercepted several outbound communications and it looks like Admiral George is planning to defect."

Peter wasn't even surprised by bad news anymore. "We should arrest and execute him immediately."

"It's not that simple" interjected Millie. "I've been monitoring all enemy communications and I've been able to extrapolate Lewis's movements. And while I haven't been able to intercept all of George's communications, it appears that there's a 92% probability that he'll insist on being brought in by Lewis himself and that Lewis will have to meet him half way as a precautionary measure."
