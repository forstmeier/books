The two took off running across the city rooftops with Bernard leading the way. Peter was able to keep up but was hindered in his ability to fight with his missing arm. Bernard more than compensated for his loss.

Millie materialized over peter's shoulder. "The self-destruct is starting to pilot ships into the city on suicide runs! We need to rift it all, rift the city! We need to save the inhabitants!"

"Where?"

"I'll handle it!"

Peter again cast away the sword he had been defending himself with and moved to run closely in Bernard's wake of destruction. A massive swirling sandstorm kicked up around them as Peter and Millie began to defend the city. Rifts summoned by Peter began to consume the city within the storm and shields sporadically rose around them to deflect incoming blasts while they ran. Chaos grew to unimaginable levels as buildings and blocks began to disappear in turmoil and dark smoke.

As they arrived at the perimeter of the headquarters several enemy shoulders rifted near them and leaped in to attack.

"Go!" shouted Bernard. "I'll hold them off!" And with that she whirled off to intercept the attackers. Without breaking stride she jumped down from the rooftop to ground level into an alleyway to engage the enemy.

As he continued to run, everything began to become hazy to Peter. The energy, focus, effort, pain, drive, exhaustion, sorrow, and loss all began to wash over him, hitting him all at once. Swamped with guilt, swamped with agony.

His sprint became a stagger as he approached the headquarters building Millie had marked. The storm surrounding them rose in pitch - tearing at the very fabric of the world as Peter lost himself totally to the power. He stumbled forwards and throwing a kinetic blast, blew the small entrance door from its hinges.

Everything was blurry and vague before his eyes and he barely made it through the doorway. He felt himself instinctively release a torrent of lightening on the oncoming sentries before he fell to his knees.

He crawled forward and heard Millie calling out in his ear but it was like she was miles away. He crawled forward not knowing where he was going before slumping forward onto the ground. He reached out his hand as far as he could and with what energy he had left he reached out and felt a small click in the back of his mind before the world sank into darkness.
