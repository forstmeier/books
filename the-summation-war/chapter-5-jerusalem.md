Peter's face was set in stone as he walked through the battle camp towards the commanders' tent. During the several months of open conflict since Arthur's defection, the season had turned to winter where they were Earth-side. It was far colder and dustings of snow clung to the ground of their small but dense encampment. A short ways above him in the air, a half dozen warships were anchored all heavily battle scarred even in the short time the war had been going.

The campaign was a difficult one.

Just as he arrived at the tent, he met Bernard and the two nodded to each other. Bernard looked weary but alert. Her skill on the battlefield had been proven on many occasions. When she moved through a crowded battlefield, it was not so much that she could predict where her opponents would be as much as she could will them into the exact position she needed them to be - every movement was natural and delivered more like a well-thought out argument than a soldier in combat.

That and her ability to lead effectively from the front had been instrumental in many loyalist victories. Tactically, she was a genius, and could deliver success out of the mouth of defeat consistently. Even so, the war was dragging the energy from her as it was everyone else.

They ducked into the large tent to find Doyle and George pouring over holograms. The senior officers were battle clad in outfits that had also seen front-line conflict. Even with their rank, the war was touching everyone directly.

Following the initial schism instigated by the ex-chairman, Lewis had began to conquer regional nations and brought governments under his sway. The Federation stood to lead the opposition against him. Most of the conflict was centralized on Earth and as such, the loyalists sought to quickly establish a foothold on the planet's surface while securing the majority of the moon as a base of operations. Areas of Asia minor and the Arabian peninsula were under their control but more often than not they were fighting in enclaves against a surrounding enemy.

Bernard's company had been heavily involved in many of these grueling campaigns and had suffered heavy casualties. Peter had been frequently loaned to headquarters in an effort to guide overall operations but he was still deployed alongside the rest of the company to the front lines when needed. It was taking a toll on him, eating heavily into his reserves of physical and mental strength - he was exhausted but he tried not to show it and pushed on.

He knew that he was becoming increasingly cold and short-tempered with people around him, particularly following Arthur's betrayal, but he couldn't help it. If friends only led to pain and betrayal, it was better to not have any.

Millie knew that he was receding into himself and tried to lightheartedly bring him out of his shell on occasion. Peter wasn't interested and would turn the focus towards the work at had. But still, Millie tried.

Currently, they were positioned in the Karakoram mountains - rugged terrain between countries which had been seized in the loyalists' initial push to gain territory.

"How goes it?" asked Doyle as they entered.

"Our foray disrupted their advance from the west" reported Bernard. "We were able to destroy most of their heavy equipment but it was likely just a feint to distract us while they deploy elsewhere."

Doyle sighed, "Another tactical victory at the cost of a strategic loss."

George wiped his face with his hand. "He was so completely thorough with his preparations - it's truly an astounding foresight."

There was a hint of reverence in his voice that made Peter angry. There was no time or place for admiration if it wasn't going to lead directly to Lewis's downfall. Lewis was the enemy of everything they had tried to create.

"However" continued George "it looks like we've been able to identify a potential centralized command node in the distributed network he's established."

Peter leaned in. They needed to hit back, to show the world that they were strong and capable of contending with Lewis.

"There is a base far in the western reaches of this mountain range that orchestrates deployments into these regions" said George. "It appears to be functioning as a coordination hub for activity."

"And more importantly..." His voice lowered. "Arthur is there."

A chill ran down Peter's spine. Hitting back and capturing Arthur, the one who had betrayed them all, would be a just and valuable counter action. The commanders looked at him intently for his response.

"It's a major base" said the admiral "and it's heavily fortified. A large garrison appears to be stationed there and it would take a concerted effort for our forces to take it down. There's also no guarantee that Arthur wouldn't immediately move off of that target once he was aware of what we were planning."

"No, he'll be there" said Peter shaking his head. "He'll follow his orders and he'll stay until he's ordered to leave."

Doyle's face showed concern. "He's a valuable asset yes, but is it worth risking a large percentage of our available forces in order to bring him down?" She paused uncertainly. "Perhaps, if we evaluate the situation with clearer heads-"

"It doesn't matter what I feel" interrupted Peter. "We just need to kill him."

A silence fell on the table. While Doyle looked uneasy, George seemed pleased with the decision. Bernard was implacable as always, as she gazed intently at Peter. He looked away in annoyance - she knew him too well at this point and knew he was on a full tilt.

Millie popped up. "I agree with Peter: we should move immediately on that post. It will give us an opportunity to both seize a valuable strategic position that compromises the enemy's mobility while also removing a major player from the board. This makes sense."

Doyle's face was still set in a frown. "I don't disagree, but are we thinking in purely strategic terms here?" Clearly, she was concerned over Peter's state of mind in coming to this decision.

"It doesn't matter - it's the end result that we need."

That ended the discussion and conversation quickly turned to planning the actual operation. What they arrived at was a ruse where their position and two other major conflict points would engage in a choreographed retreat to pool resources and launch a single offensive on the fortress.

Throughout the discussions, Doyle continued to object to the all-or-nothing approach insisting that it was too high a risk given their current predicament but was overruled each time as Peter would invoke his position as Proctor. However, Peter also eventually conceded that it would be more prudent to capture Arthur than to kill him as he would be valuable intelligence resource. He could tell by the way they were looking at him throughout the discussions that he was acting strangely - it made him even angrier but he tried not to show it.

Early the next morning, the weather was heavily overcast which perpetuated the general sense of gloom. Orders were issue and assets were mobilized.

The plan was on.

Peter was deployed with Bernard's squad to one of the flank positions that the pooled resources would be drawn from. The situation there was tenuous at best, making their feint forwards and planned withdrawal all the more convincing. They were zipped directly to the frontline of the combat zone on a gunboat, arriving shortly after the offensive began.

Peter lost himself to the frenzy of the battle. Whirling and slashing, he cut through their lines and began devastating their infantry positions. Quickly, his tactics turned from pure engagement to inflicting pain - he wanted to make his opponents suffer.

He began crushing them under objects he'd hurl telekinetically and burn them to death with lightening. Millie kept shouting over his bloodlust, desperately trying to pull him from his madness with only limited success. Then the order for retreat came and Peter reluctantly fell back.

Again, they boarded a gunboat and where whisked off towards the staging grounds for the main assault. Everything appeared to be moving according to plan but Peter barely paid any attention. He didn't care about the casualties, he just wanted to end this with Arthur; he'd doggedly pursue this to the very end. He would take this thing, this strength, from Lewis.

After a few hours their gunboat caught up with the main force which was already flying low across the planet's surface towards their target. They would hit hard and fast. It wouldn't be long before the enemy knew what they were doing but ideally they would be able to strike well before reinforcements could arrive.

Peter stood looking out over the terrain whisking by outside of the gunboat's doorway. Millie materialized next to him with a look of unease on her face - it was like she didn't know him anymore after having witnessed his fury on the battlefield.

"There's an incoming transmission from General Doyle."

Peter nodded and extended his upturned hand to display the message. Doyle appeared in his palm, fully equipped in a bulky suit of armor.

"The plan appears to be unfolding within the acceptable parameters. We're actively monitoring communications and there's nothing out of the ordinary to indicate that they've picked up on our movements as of yet. Our buildup may have gone unnoticed with the two peripheral "victories" happening simultaneously."

Peter nodded in grim satisfaction.

"What is the status of mobilization?" asked Millie.

"Nearly complete - your contingent should be at full force in the next half hour."

Bernard stepped into the hanger as Doyle's image disappeared. "You'll be leading the assault on the outer post."

Peter stiffened.

"Not the main base?"

Bernard shook her head.

"What? Why not?!" he asked furiously.

"Because you have been ordered to do so."

"Captain-"

"Silence, soldier!" barked Bernard. Peter instinctively came to attention and fell silent but still fuming on the inside. Bernard stepped forward, looking into his eyes while he stared straight ahead.

"We're in an active combat zone and I have tactical command - you will obey these orders or risk court martial - do you understand?"

"Yes, ma'am" muttered Peter reluctantly.

She clearly didn't want him engaging Arthur directly after having witnessed his conduct on the feint operation.

"Approaching targets" came a voice over the intercom.

The two were quickly joined by the rest of the squad who donned their helmets and prepared their weapons. Just a few minutes later came the first rounds of anti-aircraft fire.

Gunboat doors swung open and Peter and his squad leapt from the flying vehicle and rocketed down upon their target. Without pausing Peter began "smoking" and hurled himself down into and along a defensive trench the enemy had constructed, cutting down every defender in his path.

Landing on the edge, he whipped his sword through the torso of a soldier before firing a rocket down into a bunker below him in the trench. Fire and smoke shot out along with the cries of its inhabitants. He turned and stalked towards a small group of infantrymen rushing down on him.

Bloodlust rose again in his head and dropping his helmet, let out a roar of anger as he sprinted forward. Blood and dirt flew around them as they dueled furiously. One by one they fell, and the last Peter grabbed by the throat as he gutted her.

He looked into the woman's eyes as the life left her body before throwing her into the mud at his feet. He felt nothing but anger.

"They've taken the fortress" spoke Millie softly in his ear - she had given up trying to curb his destruction. "...And Arthur."

Peter stiffened. Without saying a word, he engaged his boosters and shot off across the still-active battlefield towards the fortress in the distance.

He touched down just outside of the gate.

"Destroy it all!" Peter shouted to the soldiers who were actively herding prisoners and seizing resources while establishing a perimeter around the conquered base. They paused.

"DESTROY IT!"

He was not only a lieutenant in their eyes but also the Proctor. Some began to dismantle equipment or stack it into piles for destruction as he stormed through the gate. One captive seized the moment and snatched a weapon from the ground and turned to fire at Peter. But Peter was too fast.

He hurled himself forwards with a yell, crushing the soldier into the wall behind him. The body fell broken and lifeless to the ground. Peter continued on as if nothing had happened.

His brow was furrowed and a fire was in his eyes. He stalked through the inner courtyard, he stalked through the inner passageways, he stalked through room after room.

Searching, searching, searching. He knew where he was going without even knowing it.

At last he came to a door at the end of a hallway and threw it open. Bernard was there, standing next to a large, wooden chair with her sword drawn but resting at her side - unmoving but on guard.

In the chair sat Arthur.

He was clad in battle equipment but he appeared to be peaceful, almost relaxed, as he sat there, a prisoner. It was almost as if he hadn't put up a fight - maybe he hadn't. Peter walked over and stood before him nearly shaking with anger.

"Why."

It was more of a statement than a question. Arthur looked up.

"Why, what, sir?"

"Why did you do all this?"

"It is what's best, sir. For everyone and for you."

"I...don't...don't recite what HE would say."

"Who, sir?"

"Don't just repeat what he says - everything he says is to manipulate me - that's what this is all about!"

"Sir-"

"DON'T CALL ME SIR!"

"...Lieutenant-"

"Just...stop."

Arthur looked at the floor in silence.

"I am sorry, Peter. I never wanted any of this, but it must be done. Your story must be-"

Peter stepped forward raising his hand as he did so. Arthur abruptly went silent and shook for a brief moment. A soft popping noise and a spark came from the back of his head. His photoreceptors went dark and he slumped slightly in the chair.

Peter felt an overwhelming rage in his head quickly replaced by a queasiness to then immediately be supplanted by utter rage again. His shaking hands shot up and with a roar, a sword appeared, and he swung down shattering the chair and the dead husk sitting in it.

Bernard stared in surprise.

"He was a vital resource - capturing him was our whole objective."

"He's been neutralized. It'll be a greater loss to Lewis than benefit to us."

Peter was half trying to convince himself of that. Millie appeared between them staring at the dead robot on the floor.

"We're seeing reinforcements moving in now - they're responding much more quickly than expected" she said, looking up. "It looks like they expected this."

Bernard looked at Peter. "I'd say that's more than likely."

"There's something else" continued Millie. "In the last few minutes, we've received reports of broad troop movements coinciding with our attacks and they appear to be moving on our forward base."

Peter starred down at the shattered husk on the floor. Even from the grave of his late trusted servant, Lewis could strike out at him. His anger cooled immediately and he felt his stomach flip looking at Arthur's broken remains.

"There's one more thing..."

Peter turned to face her.

"A prison in northern Palestine, that recently fell within the boarders of Lewis's territory, suffered a breach today. But only a single individual escaped from custody."

A cold feeling settled in Peter's stomach.

"Alexandra More has been released."

Peter turned to stare at the remains again, numbly.

"Is she really a threat?" asked Bernard. "She was effectively insane, last I heard; she was broken after the civil war."

Millie looked at Peter as she responded to Bernard. "She's dangerous to us."

She was the first person who cared about Peter and the first to truly hurt him. Lewis was bringing her onto the field to hurt him again - an emotional weakness to play against him. Killing Arthur was capturing a rook while a pawn became a queen.

"She's headed for Jerusalem apparently looking to consolidate power there under Lewis's auspices."

A loud boom sounded outside.

"We have to go" said Bernard.

Peter didn't hear anything as the two women ushered him out of the room.

He didn't hear anything as he was hurriedly moved back out of the building.

He didn't hear anything as he was loaded back into the gunboat.

He didn't hear anything as they made a fighting retreat away from the fortress.

He didn't hear anything at all.
