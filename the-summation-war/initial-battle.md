While she spoke, the company had been deploying itself - mechs and accompanying soldiers launched from the hanger to engage the enemy. Gunboats and soldiers were descending on the outskirts of the base through the defensive artillery fire. Without breaking pace in her speeding mech, Bernard barked out orders.

"Alpha Squad, take left and draw fire. Beta and Gamma, move right and focus on containment. Delta - with me up the middle to outward pincer into the flanks. Go!"

"Yes, ma'am!" and the platoon split on their respective assignments.

Two enemy mechs, of a similar size and build, dropped down in front of the running squad and opened fire. Bernard fired back as she moved forward, jumping and propelling herself over a building to the left - surprising both the oncoming mechs and the enemies she immediately engaged on the other side out of Peter's line of site.

Peter and the remaining squad dispersed while exchanging fire in an effort to flank the oncoming combatants. An explosion erupted from where Bernard had disappeared to. Her Big came flying back over the building, partially throw by the explosion. In one smooth motion she body kicked one out into the squad's field of fire to be quickly cut down before pivoting and launching a heavy grenade, point blank, into the other's command cabin.

"Keep going" Bernard ordered as she stepped over the fallen carcass. The team pressed forward, engaging the oncoming waves of the assault. Two squad members had left their damaged but functional Bigs on autonomous mode, and were now riding on the back of Peter's own mech.
