Together the squad managed to establish a beachhead against the invading units dropping in. While the outer sections of the base had fallen, they were able to begin mounting a defense of the interior, centering around headquarters.

The rhythm of true battle was something Peter had never experienced before. Training and dueling had prepared him somewhat, but a full-scale battle was totally new. In some ways it was even exhilarating, engaging the enemy one-on-one. Almost intoxicating.

"Naval reinforcements" came Millie's voice through his headset. He looked up and not far above them in the atmosphere were two battleships which quickly began trading blasts with the enemy cruisers. It was the turning point they needed.

Bernard ordered the company to stand down; pursuing the attackers was now in the hands of the battleships and their fighter contingents. Those cruisers that had survived the battleships' onslaught made emergency jumps into hyperspace, stranding a handful of assault forces who were quickly rounded up and captured.

About an hour later, Peter and Bernard, stripped off their equipment and reconvened at the command center. George greeted them with a frown.
