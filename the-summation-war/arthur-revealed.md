Peter summoned Arthur.

"You called for me, sir."

"Yes, Arthur. What have you found so far in your search for information moles?"

"Unfortunately, nothing conclusive as of yet, sir. There are many potential infractions but no definitive breaches. I have compiled a list of suspicious activities but none of them are actionable as of yet."

He turned and tapped several commands into a console and the hologram began displaying scrolling rolls of data.

"Here's the list of channels that I have investigated."

The group began reading through the data as it moved past and discussed courses of action. Peter was disappointed that nothing concrete had been unearthed by Arthur's examination. It was every channel, every communication.

Suddenly, a dark thought flew through Peter's mind. His stomach went cold. Stepping forward, he tapped the command console and the data on the screen began to shift.

The others stopped their conversation and turned to watch. Every one of the scrolling rows quickly filtered away. Peter typed in a few more commands.

A single channel appeared.

"What is this?" asked George.

"It's the channels that have not been evaluated" answered Bernard.

"There's only one. It's Arthur's" said Peter softly.

Peter tapped a few more commands with his Proctor-level authorization and thousands of lines began flowing across the screen. Each was a message and every message had the same destination. The group turned to look at Arthur; Millie materialized over the table with a look of incredulity on her face.

"You were communicating with Lewis" she breathed.

"Arthur...?"

"I am sorry, sir" said the robot, turning to face Peter.

"It was you."

"Yes, sir. I was following orders and acting under the auspices of ITAM & Co."

"We trusted you - I trusted you. And you betrayed us to Lewis."

"I hope that you will understand my actions one day, sir."

A misty smoke appeared and quickly enveloped the robot and in an instant he disappeared, rifting away.

A blade slashed through the air where the robot had stood a half a second before. Bernard had shot forward attempting to bring him down but he had vanished before she could.

There was a loud boom outside.

"Shit!" shouted Millie. "I'll go after him!" and she disappeared.

"What the hell was that?" bellowed George.

"He's escaping!" shouted Doyle. "Track him! He can't have gone far."

A soldier shouted from the other side of the room "Sir, a sloop just dropped out of hyperspace at surface level."

It was the getaway vehicle risking a dangerous low-level hyperspace exit in order to retrieve Arthur. There must have been some pre-arranged escape in order to time it so perfectly with Arthur's rift.

"All battleships, open fire on that sloop!" George ordered.

"They can't do that" said Bernard "the base is in the line of fire."

"Dammit!"

There was another boom outside as the sloop jumped back into hyperspace.

"The sloop is gone, sir"

"Dammit!"

"Look" said Doyle, pointing towards the center table.

There stood another glowing hologram of Lewis. Millie reappeared shaking her head, unsuccessful in her attempt to stop Arthur's escape. Peter walked to the center of the room in a daze and activated the message.

"Human history is littered with violence and this is proving to be yet another chapter in that ever-growing book. This chapter has been written for the Proctor and brings great danger to the broader humanity which that office was tasked with defending." Whatever must be done in the coming conflict will be done to ensure victory of Man. Whatever you use to defend yourself, I will use to break you. Whatever you take as your strength, I will cripple you with it. Hope, courage, faith will all fail you."

The hologram snapped off and the room erupted into hubbub but Peter couldn't hear any of it over the ringing in his own ears. All he could think of was Arthur. This was more than a betrayal. His oldest friend was lost.

Had he ever really been his friend?
