Peter was sitting on some crates outside of the docking bay between training sessions looking over the terrain thinking to himself while eating his lunch.

Bernard walked up behind him dressed in fatigues and waved Peter to sit as he attempted to stand to attention. She hopped up onto the crate next to him.

"Captain."

"Lieutenant."

"Preparations seem to be going pretty well."

Bernard nodded.

"Yes, they're certainly moving fast enough."

Peter looked down at his food. Bernard looked over at him.

"What is it?"

He paused a moment and took a deep breath before letting out a long, quiet sigh.

"I'm not sure we'll ever be really prepared for what's coming. We might just manage to get everything together in time but still come up short."

He continued, "Lewis is way more dangerous than you could possibly know. It's clear that he's a master strategist, and even if we ever gain a tactical advantage, he'll still win this war."

Bernard's brow furrowed slightly. It was rare to see actual consternation from her.

"Why do you say that?"

"My history is proof."

He paused again.

"I've never talked about this, and not much was made of it following the civil war. The hearings only briefly touched on it, oddly enough, and it was never publicized in its full context."

"Lewis orchestrated the entirety of the Thirty-Minute War. He did it to both instigate and bring about the downfall of rebellious factions within ITAM and expunge any possible threats to my ascension as Proctor."

"He's the reason I'm here at all. There's nothing to say that he hasn't also planned out every single step of this campaign as well. For all we know, this is just an extension of that civil war - this is just another step in whatever his plan is."

He turned to look the captain in the eye.

"But his most dangerous asset, by far, is his knowledge of me. He knows my history - he was responsible for all of it, he ordered it. He's known every minute of every process; worked with me, molded me, my thinking, my abilities."

"I'm both the king and the pawn in his game and everything that I hope to do he will counter. And he won't just counter it - he'll use it to his advantage."
