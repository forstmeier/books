Peter turned away, shaking off Bernard's hand and stalked down the hill towards the group of captured soldiers. He walked right up to one of the men at the front of the group, on his knees with his hands shackled behind his back - he didn't raise his eyes as Peter approached.

"Execute them" he said as he looked down at the man before him. The soldier straightened in surprise, looking up into Peter's calm face.

"What?" asked Millie incredulously.

"You heard me. Execute them."

"We can't do that - they're prisoners of war!"

"You will do as you are ordered" he called over to the soldiers behind him, ignoring Millie's protests.

"Peter, this goes against the rules of engagement - this is a criminal act!"

"DO IT!" screamed Peter at the nearest officer.

The soldiers hesitated and a fury flew up in Peter's heart as turned and saw their uncertainty. Letting out a roar, a sword appeared in his hand and with a whirl he chopped down towards the kneeling soldier's head.

A blur flew between them and Peter's sword blade spun away, harmlessly deflected from its intended target. Peter caught his balance and looked down at his hand which was now only gripping the hilt of his destroyed weapon. It had been cleanly cut below the guard but above his hand.

He spun to see Bernard standing with her blade drawn, hanging loosely at her side. She had shot forwards and intercepted his blow, precisely cutting the weapon out of his hand.

"I will not allow you to do that" she said calmly.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder. With a sad look she disappeared and then reappeared over Bernard's shoulder before disappearing again. She had changed her allegiance.
