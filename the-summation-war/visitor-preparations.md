The two walked across the small compound. Only short, cylindrical shapes sticking up just higher than the grass indicated the presence of the underground buildings. An office, living quarters, dining area, exercise room. A small docking pool for vehicles. Home.

The pair approached a raised dias equipped with embedded holographic emitters which served as an outdoors office for Peter.

"Well" said Millie, "I've got some other stuff to do, so I'll see you in a bit."

"Meet back up for dinner?"

"Sounds good."

The AI dematerialized and the human walked up the dias. Millie had worked closely with him over the years serving as liaison and helping to train Peter on the technical aspects of his role. Through it all they have formed a strong bond together, forged in the crucible of their initial meeting and subsequent trials. Peter could talk to her about things that he told no one else; interestingly enough, she often did the same. She was a good friend and a trusted confidant.

The rest of the afternoon followed the typical routine of continuing to maintain the Federation's structures, operations, and directives while the little team waited for their guest to arrive. Eventually the sun began to move lower in the sky and Peter returned to the kitchen room. He began to prepare dinner and chatted with Millie while she tossed a holographic ball against the wall.
