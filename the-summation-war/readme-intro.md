> **procplan** is a small script that ensures continuity of the founder's plan; it is responsible for transferring necessary access codes to the designated successor. In the event that a successor has not been selected at the time of transference, the fallback contingency operation is triggered.  
> Administration and maintenance of this script is under the responsibility of Project 001-6bba42.
