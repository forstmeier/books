"You're really worried about this, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Well, that's combat for you."

"There's always a chance that the enemy is just better, no matter how well or how hard you fight."

"No one's better than you" muttered Peter.

"Not that I've met, no, but that doesn't mean there isn't."

"How will you win when you do encounter that enemy?"

"I don't know. But I'm going to fight."

Peter snorted quietly. Bernard was an impressive individual and despite his misgivings one couldn't help but feel invincible around her. She placed a hand on his shoulder and they smiled at each other.
