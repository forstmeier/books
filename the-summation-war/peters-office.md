It was cool in Peter's office.

The space was relatively small but comfortable and functional. Dozens of screens and holographic readouts lined the plaster walls in a paradoxically orderly chaos. Recessed lights in the ceiling gave off a soft illumination complementing the cool glow of the monitors. Situated in the center of it all was a desk upon which sat several more monitors and a keyboard. The rugs beneath his feet were thick and provided a splash of color.

Peter liked it; his office provided a place to think and to work without distraction.

It had been nearly ten years since he had ascended to the Proctorship role. And over that time, he had overseen a heavy reformation of ITAM's operations following the loss of the organization's reputation as a result of the civil war. Peter began setting about repositioning projects to help mold the broken organization into an independent nation-state in its own right with the interim name of the Federation of Pangea.

He helped to work and guide the formation of a philosophy and doctrine, something that could truly become a tool towards the betterment of humanity all the while continuing to serve it in its best capacity.

He sought something absolute, holistic, and simple. It was all done through trial and error; nothing came easily and there were many hard lessons learned. And all of this he tried to do with as little direct influence as possible. Even now, he was hesitant to assume an official leadership role and instead chose to work on his own, providing guidance and input remotely. Being away from the leaders, the peers, the subordinates, alleviated the sense of his responsibility, hence his grassland hermitage.
