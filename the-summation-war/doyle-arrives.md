Outside the evening breeze hissing through the tall grass was interrupted by the whine of an approaching engine. The two stepped out of the doorway and saw the skiff they observed earlier landing in the vehicle pool. Doyle stood by looking on as Arthur jumped down and tethered the vehicle. A boarding ramp extended from the ship and Doyle briskly walked down to meet them.

She wore civilian clothes but her heavy-duty military-grade boots were a telltale signal of her profession.

"Good evening, General Doyle" said Peter as he stepped forward to shake hands.

"Good afternoon, Proctor."

"This is Millie. I believe the two of you have worked before."

"Yes, we have" nodded Doyle to Millie, "on several projects."

"How was your trip?" asked Millie.

"Quick and uneventful, thank you."

"Glad to hear it. Please, come inside. Arthur will finish up dinner and we can eat shortly." Peter led them into the dining room and Arthur disappeared through the connecting door to the kitchen. The three chatted while Arthur completed preparing the meal and served it in short order.

"You want to sit outside?" Peter asked as they wrapped up dinner. "It's quite nice outside in the evening."

"Certainly."

The sun was low in the sky and the afternoon's crisp blue and white sky had turned to purple and orange as they ascended onto the dias. Peter extended a hand and two small benches cascaded into existence as well as a small fire pit between then. Logs appear and ignited, burning rapidly into glowing embers. Orange tongues of fire occasionally licked up from the mouth formed by the wood.

"This is my outdoors work station when the weather is nice."

"It's certainly conducive to expansive thought" noted Doyle looking out across the darkening landscape.

"Freedom to work and learn without interruption. I like focusing singularly on a task, to settle in and zone out while working - it's almost meditative in a way. I guess that would make this my own little Bodhi Tree of sorts. Not that I'm the Buddha. In fact, I'm more the antithesis to that great thinker: where he taught inner perfection, I enforce external rightness. But we both have our Bodhi Trees."
