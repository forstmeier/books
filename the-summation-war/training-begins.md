Following Lewis's announcement, the mood of the camp fell.

Regardless, Peter's training began immediately and he was rapidly introduced to a rigorous daily schedule. A variety of martial activities filled his time with a significant portion dedicated to direct combat and tactics.

While a great deal of the equipment was similar to that used in the prior civil war, it had improved greatly in the interim. The armor suits were more comprehensively plated and built for direct combat.

Propulsion systems were integrated into the equipment as well as a new system of mobility. A form of localized molecular dispersal allowing rapid movement across the field instantaneously, nicknamed "rifting", or disintegrating into rushing particles, nicknamed "smoking", to fly across the battlefield. Both forms were limited in range and duration, but necessitated bringing back old fashioned hand-to-hand engagements as combatants could quickly close distances between one another. It was an immense ability but not easily controlled.

He also began learning to control the "Bigs" while acting as a "Small" - balancing his own actions while guiding the actions of the "Big" - a difficult relationship to master. Having Millie by his side was hugely beneficial as he could offload much of the coordination into her hands while focusing on the engagement at hand. While he struggled initially, he overcame the hurdle and began to build a strong capability with her support.
