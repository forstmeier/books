With a final scornful look, Peter lifted off. "Bernard's engagement began a few minutes ago - Lewis is nearby at the arranged meeting spot." Peter adjusted course per her directions shooting towards his confrontation with Lewis.

"It's coming up, on the next hill."

Peter rounded a low rise and there, in front of him, was Lewis.

He was looking out across the plain gazing in the direction of Bernard's interception operation. A heat rose in Peter's face and his vision turned a tinted rose. He let out a guttural, throat-tearing cry and increased his speed and began to partially disintegrated into a flying column of smoke.

Lewis turned to look in response to the intrusion - even now, he didn't look surprised. His bodyguards jumped forward and quickly opened fire on the approaching War Proctor. Before they could pick him off he rifted without slowing his pace right into the middle of their contingent.

Whirling, orange-golden blurs from his blade immediately struck down two guards while simultaneously disarming Lewis's quickly brandished weapon. Peter flicked off a shot from his pistol, striking Lewis in the chest, spinning him, and with a grunt, he fell to the ground.

The remaining guards converged, their blades flying. Peter jumped and spun, rapidly engaging and killing another before delivering a telekinetic blast to another shattering his body and sending his corpse flying. A blade slashed at Peter's head - he ducked, whirled, and impaled the remaining opponent through the chest. Pushing him off his blade, Peter stood to survey the scene which had unfolded in a matter of seconds.

Pure fury fueled Peter's ferocity. He turned to face the now kneeling Lewis - he was badly injured, possibly critically. Peter stood over him, brandishing his pistol.

"I, Peter, Proctor of the Federation of Pangea" spoke Peter, "in this battlefield tribunal, convened by me and chaired by myself alone, charge you with state terrorism, insurrection, instigating war, political repression, and crimes against humanity. I find you guilty on all charges and sentence you to death. Before carrying out the sentence, do you have anything further to say?"

Lewis looked up at him, his breathing labored and blood dripping from his mouth. His eyes, however, were as focused and steely as ever. It was the first time the two of them had met face-to-face, or even had a direct interaction, since before the beginning of the war.

"I wasn't sure that you had it in you - the ability to let yourself go and do whatever it takes, to sacrifice yourself to save the world. You're so close, so close...but will you be able to rescue yourself on the other side?"

Peter paused for a brief moment. And then squeezed the trigger. Lewis slumped sideways.
