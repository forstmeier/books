The general was here to convince him to become a proactive solution to this potential problem. Suddenly everything felt just as it had years ago, standing at that conference table at the outbreak of the civil war.

"That-that's not my place. Direct involvement in governance is against my main directives. I provide guidance and project management only."

"Yes, but-"

"And I could continue to fulfill that directive even after the results of this potential coup" interrupted Peter, pressing his point. "Whatever the outcome, whoever ends on top, be it your regime or someone else's, I must continue to do what is good for the Federation of Pangea and humanity. It doesn't matter what name I answer to."

"We've taken this approach for years" added Millie. "Hundreds of tasks and projects have been successfully implemented following our guidance and us following our primary directive."

For a moment, Doyle sat silent formulating her next words.

"What this coup means, what it really means, is that there is someone out there willing to break the rules. Whether or not their end goal is greater than ours, let alone good at all, is besides the point. All I know is that the Federation of Pangea is at this very minute fulfilling a great and noble goal."

"Now there is someone stepping forward, either for good or for evil, to seize power outside of the proper means to do so. In either case, they must be stopped and we'll have lost nothing for having done it."

It was an uncomfortable proposition: the potential for another civil war, perhaps worse, much worse, than the last.

"War is just if it is a necessary defense against evil."

"And who's side of this new civil war will you be on?"

"I've actively sought out alternatives to identify and meet this threat head-on."

"My allegiance lies with the mission of Pangea."
