Mustering up the courage, he finally rolled over to face Bernard with his tear-streaked, red-eyed countenance.

"We all shall fall."

Millie appeared over Bernard's shoulder. "What matters is that we get back up again."

Peter sat up and shook his head slowly. "I...I can't. I've lost too much; I've cost us too much."

He curled into a ball holding his stomach, the full weight of his actions still bearing down on him. It hurt thinking of those he had hurt.

"Yes, you can" said Millie. "And you must do it yourself for your own redemption."

He looked down at the floor without responding.

"Come back to us, Peter" said Bernard. She was truly calling him back - back from out of the abyss. For a few moments he sat thinking silently.

"We know your burden. We forgive you, Peter" said Millie. He looked up into their eyes. Millie and Bernard. They gazed on him with a calm intent and impossible patience. Like a family bringing in a wayward son.

He took another deep breath. "But what can I do? I've all but lost this war against us. I've lost the respect of the soldiers under my command. I sacrificed our greatest sources of insight into the enemy's plans. I've lost us everything." Again, he closed his eyes and turned his head down and away from their gaze.

"You can admit your faults, accept responsibility, pick yourself up, and lead us again" said Millie.

He looked back at her. "Lead you?"

"As Field Marshal."
