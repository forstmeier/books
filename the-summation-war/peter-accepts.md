Doyle again looked uncomfortable.

"This brings me to my final point: we need your presence, your physical presence."

"I can work from here, even if I choose to support this anti-coup effort" Peter objected.

The general shook her head.

"No, you must be there in-person. It's necessary for the leadership and the broader community to see your direct involvement. The direct presence of the Proctor will shore up support as well as provide a direct link to the resources under your command. Should it eventually come to it, you'll have to engage in combat either directly or indirectly."

"Honestly, this breaks with the whole intent of my self-imposed exile here on _Pangea_. Avoiding outside interference or control has been my number one priority following the Thirty Minute War. I never want to be manipulated like that again, there's just too much at stake. If I become involved, it'll just increase the tensions and inevitably lead to strife."

"This situation arose regardless of those decisions" said Doyle softly.

A silence fell over the group and they stared into the glowing embers.

"If it truly comes to it" signed Doyle "you will receive orders from the Federation of Pangea board of directors compelling your cooperation with the counter-coup and any necessary defenses. Pangea is unwilling for you to simply choose to remain neutral in the coming conflict."

"Why even ask us, then? Why this sad pretense of freedom?" asked Millie, quietly.

Doyle was silent. Peter looked down at his hands, slowly and gently clenching and unclenching them, watching the patterns of his creases and callouses move.

"I don't have much of a choice, do I?"

"No."

"You must understand, if not now then hopefully eventually you will, that you cannot be allowed to become a pawn in a nefarious plan despite your good intentions. It is far better you become directly involved with the counter-coup unwillingly. Your official orders will be issued in the morning."

Peter nodded, resigning himself to his fate. The fire began burning low and the three again looked on in silence.

Eventually, Doyle excused herself and Arthur appeared to show her to her room. Millie too disappeared for the night, leaving Peter alone on the platform.

Sweeping away the furniture back into energy, he was left on the platform with nothing around him except the black landscape and the expanse of stars above.
