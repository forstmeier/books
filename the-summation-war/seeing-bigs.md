After these initial introductions came a series of presentations and discussions outlining preparations for mobilizing the forces necessary to counteract the potential enemy. While intelligence pointed at a growing threat, it still presented the great unknown as to who the enemy might actually be and from where they would strike. Eventually, they were dismissed and Peter followed Bernard back to her company barracks.

Bernard was silent along the walk and although Peter had grown comfortable with it in his long self-imposed exile, he somehow felt out of his element around the captain.

"What do you, uh, do, captain?" came his question, awkwardly stumbling in to break their silence.

"I command Scipio Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th Mechanized Regiment - a special purpose unit with a smaller headcount than a typical company at forty-six members."

"Uh, oh...yeah."

It was a matter-of-fact answer but it was still just as awkward for Peter to listen to as his own question that prompted the response.

"Smooth" whispered Millie in his ear. Peter didn't ask anymore questions.

The pair arrived at a side hanger and were greeted by a sight new to Peter. Before them were dozens of large, bipedal mechanical figures standing approximately twenty feet high. All bore armor plating along their major limbs - rounded, close-fitting pauldrons, circular neck guards, broad chest plates. Tight bunches of tubes formed sinews surrounding smooth ball joints evoking biological imagery. A small head protruded forward from a large divot in the chest with three small, ovular eyes peering outward.

Even with their armor plating, they looked quick and nimble enough to carry themselves swiftly through whatever combat zone they were clearly destined for.

"Pretty cool, huh?" spoke up Millie in his ear. "These are some of the mechanized weaponry available to the ITAM ground forces. They're easily outfitted with additional weapons" she continued as she appeared next to Peter and waved in the direction of several large boxes surrounded by hand-held and hull-integrated weapons.

Peter and Bernard walked down the loosely ordered rows of the mechs which appeared to be split into several groupings.

"We call them "Bigs" said Bernard, gesturing to the mechs, "and we, their counterparts, are "Smalls". In action we combine the two modes of combat to ensure versatility throughout the course of a mission."
