Peter's face was set in stone as he walked through the battle camp towards the commanders' tent. During the several months of open conflict since Arthur's defection, the season had turned to winter where they were Earth-side. It was far colder and dustings of snow clung to the ground of their small but dense encampment. A short ways above him in the air, a half dozen warships were anchored all heavily battle scarred even in the short time the war had been going.

The campaign was a difficult one.

Just as he arrived at the tent, he met Bernard and the two nodded to each other. Bernard looked weary but alert. Her skill on the battlefield had been proven on many occasions. When she moved through a crowded battlefield, it was not so much that she could predict where her opponents would be as much as she could will them into the exact position she needed them to be - every movement was natural and delivered more like a well-thought out argument than a soldier in combat.

That and her ability to lead effectively from the front had been instrumental in many loyalist victories. Tactically, she was a genius, and could deliver success out of the mouth of defeat consistently. Even so, the war was dragging the energy from her as it was everyone else.

They ducked into the large tent to find Doyle and George pouring over holograms. The senior officers were battle clad in outfits that had also seen front-line conflict. Even with their rank, the war was touching everyone directly.

Following the initial schism instigated by the ex-chairman, Lewis had began to conquer regional nations and brought governments under his sway. The Federation stood to lead the opposition against him. Most of the conflict was centralized on Earth and as such, the loyalists sought to quickly establish a foothold on the planet's surface while securing the majority of the moon as a base of operations. Areas of Asia minor and the Arabian peninsula were under their control but more often than not they were fighting in enclaves against a surrounding enemy.

Bernard's company had been heavily involved in many of these grueling campaigns and had suffered heavy casualties. Peter had been frequently loaned to headquarters in an effort to guide overall operations but he was still deployed alongside the rest of the company to the front lines when needed. It was taking a toll on him, eating heavily into his reserves of physical and mental strength - he was exhausted but he tried not to show it and pushed on.

He knew that he was becoming increasingly cold and short-tempered with people around him, particularly following Arthur's betrayal, but he couldn't help it. If friends only led to pain and betrayal, it was better to not have any.

Millie knew that he was receding into himself and tried to lightheartedly bring him out of his shell on occasion. Peter wasn't interested and would turn the focus towards the work at had. But still, Millie tried.
