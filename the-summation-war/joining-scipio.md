They arrived at a unit which appeared to be untouched and bore none of the wear-and-tear the others had. Bernard motioned him forward. He did so, looking upwards into the face of the squatting giant.

Its eyes lit up and instantly trained on Peter's face. The mech leaned forward onto its knuckles as Peter stepped back in surprise. A deep, gravely voice rumbled from the machine, "Identified: Lieutenant First Class Peter. Assigned to: Unit 14-99, _Rommel_-Class Mechanized Battle Armor. Begin personalized piloting configuration setup program."

Its head and chest plate unsealed and swung open to reveal an interior command cabin within the main body. Kneeling down on one knee, a short set of ladder rungs sprung from the upright shin leading into the chest. Bernard nodded encouragement to Peter's questioning look.

He clambered up the mech and into the tight cockpit; a partial standing chair with miniature embedded gravity points held the pilot in place while wiry braces held shin and forearm pedals allowing for greater control of the suit while providing haptic feedback. Hologram emitters were scattered throughout providing a wide view of the field. Peter climbed into the seat and at the touch of a few buttons, the display emitters swirled to life.

A gentle tornado of holographic bits appeared next to him before coalescing into a bust of Millie.

"Hello there" she said by way of greeting.

"What are you doing in the mech?" he asked.

"Serving as your Big-Small interface. That job is typically assigned to a lesser AI but I have orders to replace it. I'm gonna have to get used to watching where I step - you're so much smaller than me now."

"I so appreciate your sacrifice" he replied sarcastically.

"Don't mention it. Go ahead and run the auto setup program and the practice operations to get a better feel for this thing." She dispersed into fragments and Peter turned back to the holographic controls.

At his command, the Big straightened up and the chest hatched sealed him inside. All of the visual holograms snapped on immediately providing a 180 degree image of the hanger.

Placing his arms and legs into the braces, he let the machinery automatically click into place around his digits and extremities. He could feel resistance as he began to move his arms about - probably an intentional design to provide a scaled sense of the Big's actual movement capabilities which allowed the pilot to make the machine a true extension of their own body. His hands came up before his face and through the hologram he could see the titans hands mirror his own. Little human fingers wiggled and giant metal fingers wiggled in unison.

Leaning forward slightly he could see his slightly stockier robot legs firmly planted below him. Shifting weight back and forth, he could feel the foot pedals adjusting their resistance.

This is so cool.

After some additional physical exploration and after completing the setup program, he shut the mech down which settled back into its previous hunched position to let him egress. Bernard approached him.

"Training will officially begin tomorrow. Unfortunately, it will be something of a "crash course" given our constrained schedule and you'll be provided with the bare minimum necessary in order for you to effectively follow commands and work with the unit. We're not intending on placing you on the front lines but we want to be prepared for every contingency."

With that she led him to the barracks which were more like dormitories with each room housing four bunks and lockers what few amenities the teammates might have. Along the back wall of each was a long, shared computer terminal for work and planning. The three other occupants of the room jumped to the floor and stood as Bernard entered the room - not at full attention, at ease. It was clear that she commanded a strong and earned respect from her subordinates.

"Your squad mates will be responsible for teaching you the daily regimen and schedule required of a lieutenant." Peter got the sense that Scipio company as a whole had been imbued with Bernard's focus and strength.

A blinking alert pinged on Bernard's wrist. Holding her arm forward she tapped a button and a hologram of Doyle appeared.

"Return to the war room immediately. Bring Lieutenant Peter."
