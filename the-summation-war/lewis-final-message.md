A surprised look flew over Peter's face. "W-what?"

"General Doyle pushed for it. She recommended it for the endgame which would provide us with a strong, central figurehead. Someone who could defeat Lewis and who can defeat himself."

"I executed him."

"You did what was necessary" interjected Millie. "He was absolutely too dangerous to be kept alive."

"Especially with More back on the battlefield" chimed in Bernard. "She has seized control of field operations with Lewis now gone and is pressing hard on Jerusalem."

"We believe that she is looking to cement her hold and strategic position so we must break her before it can be established."

Again, Peter looked down at the floor. He heard the buzz of a hologram fizzle into existence.

"Hello, Peter."

Looking up, there stood an image of the late former chairman. He was clad in battle armor and dark robes - not unlike those Peter had last seen him in.

"This final message is to you, specifically. This is the story that is being written for you, the Proctor. It is another of the long string of great burdens that I am sorry to have placed upon your shoulders. But that is why I am leaving this message for you now."

"This war I have created is needed. In order to draw out the evil in the world and across the globe, it needed to be given the opportunity to rise to the surface. It was to draw out those who would seek to oppress and destroy their fellow man and unite them under a single name. Mine."

"My actions are inexcusable - a necessary evil but one that is unforgivable. I am throwing away my soul for the world and I do not hope to find it again. If you are watching this, then you have already killed me but even so I do not know that you will win. I have released a great terror on the world and your only task is to see that it does not come to full fruition."

"Your greatest accomplishment will always be the good you choose to do with the time given to you in this world. No parent is proud of their child for their child's sake - they are proud of who they become."

The hologram disappeared and Peter looked down again briefly before raising his gaze to meet the two women before him. A renewed sense of purpose filled his body.

"I cannot erase my past, but I can try to rise above it."

Both nodded with satisfaction.
