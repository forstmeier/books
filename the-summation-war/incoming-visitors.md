His daydreaming was cut short by Millie who materialized in the air above his desk.

"Hey" she playfully shouted at him, "wake up!"

"I'm awake, I'm awake" Peter grumbled.

"Well, try and look it, kiddo, we've got company." She waved a hologram to the center console which showed a sailing vessel skimming across the grassland. Someone was coming to see him in his little hideaway.

One of the two signatures onboard indicated Arthur. The robot had continued to serve as his assistant and official attache and was currently ferrying his guest who had requested this face-to-face meeting. Peter's location was not a real secret, but he appreciated his privacy and the coordinates were not maintained in any official maps of _Pangea_.

His visitor was General Madeline Doyle and from her prior communications, this was an urgent, top-secret meeting of vital importance. He had met the general on a few occasions but her reputation as a serious woman of action had prompted him to accept the audience.

Peter turned away from the screens and walking up a short flight of stairs he came directly to the outside landscape. Having the office space in its own dedicated module gave a nice separation between home and work.

Outside was the grassland - Peter's favorite environment on _Pangea_. While he had explored a variety of other terrains, including the deserts and mounts which he loved for their ruggedness, he ultimately settled on the simplicity that the great plains offered. Peter called them the "grass sea." They were formed from swaths of currently unused portions of _Pangea_'s surface and provided oxygen and healthy soil.

Millie again materialized next to him.

"You can't get away from me that easily."

"I wasn't trying to escape" smiled Peter.

"Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Just getting up and walking away mid-sentence is totally normal."

"Oh, sorry, I totally didn't mean to do that."

Millie ignored his apology and looked at him intently. "This meeting has got you distracted, ruffled."

Peter's mouth set in a line as he shook his head. "No."

Millie sighed with exasperation.

"I _know_ this isn't your favorite thing, but it's necessary. Something is happening, something's coming, and we need to be able to hit the ground running when it does."
