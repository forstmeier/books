George nodded and turned to begin issuing orders to his adjuncts. Doyle's subordinates also dispersed about their duties.

"I also wanted to introduce your combat unit assignment. Should conflict arise, you will likely need a field placement. We've put you with one of our more lightweight armored divisions that handles a flexible range of mission types."

She signaled to an officer standing quietly off to the side of the room.

"This is Captain Nicoletta Bernard, commander of Scipio Company."

Bernard stepped forward. She had a sight build and her brown hair was pulled back into a messy bun; she couldn't be much older than Peter. Her partially equipped armor suit and sword hilt were battle-worn and the red scarf around her neck was heavily frayed at the edges. Clearly she had seen a great deal of action.

Her solemn, expressionless countenance gave nothing away to Peter.

"Bernard is a highly decorated soldier, according to her file" whispered Millie in his ear. "One of the most powerful combatants in the field, apparently. Brilliant tactician and leader. Most of her missions are open-ended and require a great deal of adaptability and ingenuity."

Her self-assured but unassuming stance was one of a warrior and a force to be reckoned with.

The two exchanged nods.

"You'll be attached to Bernard's unit under her command initially as a lieutenant. You'll be undergoing her squad's training and should we see action, you will be following her orders in broader strategy with the plan of elevating you to Arch Captain of the unit which will remain under her tactical command and your strategic initiatives."

Doyle turned to face Peter.

"You are still Proctor and after your initial training and martial exposure will be assuming broader directorial involvement and autonomy utilizing the privileges of the Proctor rank."

"Understood?"

It was an acceptable arrangement - one where Peter could "get his feet wet" in preparation for the militaristic role he would potentially have to regrettable shoulder. While the outcome was an uncomfortable one, the approach in delivering it was reasonable.

"Yes, ma'am."

The general's face showed that she was relieved and pleased that with his response.

"Excellent."
