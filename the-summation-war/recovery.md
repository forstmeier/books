Peter's eyes opened. He was in a clean, white environment laying on a gurney dressed in a medical gown.

Memories came flooding back - all of them. Arthur's betrayal and Arthur's death. George's betrayal and George's capture. Lewis's betrayal and Lewis's execution. Bernard's defiance and their duel.

All came rushing back in but none of the anger, just a cold sickness in the pit of his stomach. He curled into a ball on his side thinking of what had been done, thinking of what he had done and what he had tried to do. There was no more outward anger, no more hatred, just self-loathing and a deep sadness. A deep, unrelenting sadness.

He curled tighter on the bed trying to force the images from his mind. The door to the medical bay slid open and in walked Bernard. Peter quickly rolled to the other side facing away from her but felt her approach the bed and sit on the edge.

His throat clenched up and he sobbed into the blanket. A few moments passed as he cried quietly.

"I failed you all" he sniffed.

There was a brief pause and Bernard responded, "It wasn't just that you failed us - you failed yourself." Peter scrunched tighter but knew the words were true. "You stand for something more; you represent what is good and what can be. You represent the good that we could do for this world and our responsibility in it."

His throat tightened again - he couldn't bear to look at her.

"But you're also just a man."

Again he sobbed.

"A man with faults, misdeeds, errors in judgment...failures." He sniffled and wiped his eyes without turning. "No matter what you do or how good you are, you will always fall. We all shall fall." Peter took a deep, raspy breath.
