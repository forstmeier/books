Both duelists jetted forwards and their blades met. Slash, parry, blow, block, chop, evade. The combatants whirled with their blades dancing in deadly harmony. Leaping and jetting, tooth and claw, as the world burned around them.

A battle within and a battle without.

But through it all, Peter was calm - centered and whole. He was grounded in the knowledge that what he was doing was right; what he was doing was what he was called to do. He would put down his own life to ensure that the mission was carried through and to bring this tyranny down.

The two fighters were surprisingly evenly match and More knew this. She broke off their struggle and leaping backwards she looked to the sky above.

A small loyalist capital ship was sailing low over the city. More raised her hand towards it and little holograms danced around her hand. One and then two opposition fighters abruptly slammed into its aft section destroying its shields and propulsion systems.

The ship began to fall towards the city below, much of which had not been evacuated prior to the battle meaning the crash would be the death of hundreds of innocents. Peter threw his sword from his hands and stepped forwards towards the falling vessel. Millie materialized next to him and both raised their arms in unison.

Like twin Atlases carrying the world, they reached out towards the falling vessel and caught it with a kinetic field. It was a massive weight and it took all of their focus to keep it afloat. And in doing so, Peter made himself utterly vulnerable to his opponent.

He knew it, More knew it. She leaped forward with her blade brandished and whipped it upwards.
