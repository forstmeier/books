He touched down just outside of the gate.

"Destroy it all!" Peter shouted to the soldiers who were actively herding prisoners and seizing resources while establishing a perimeter around the conquered base. They paused.

"DESTROY IT!"

He was not only a lieutenant in their eyes but also the Proctor. Some began to dismantle equipment or stack it into piles for destruction as he stormed through the gate. One captive seized the moment and snatched a weapon from the ground and turned to fire at Peter. But Peter was too fast.

He hurled himself forwards with a yell, crushing the soldier into the wall behind him. The body fell broken and lifeless to the ground. Peter continued on as if nothing had happened.

His brow was furrowed and a fire was in his eyes. He stalked through the inner courtyard, he stalked through the inner passageways, he stalked through room after room.

Searching, searching, searching. He knew where he was going without even knowing it.

At last he came to a door at the end of a hallway and threw it open. Bernard was there, standing next to a large, wooden chair with her sword drawn but resting at her side - unmoving but on guard.

In the chair sat Arthur.

He was clad in battle equipment but he appeared to be peaceful, almost relaxed, as he sat there, a prisoner. It was almost as if he hadn't put up a fight - maybe he hadn't. Peter walked over and stood before him nearly shaking with anger.

"Why."

It was more of a statement than a question. Arthur looked up.

"Why, what, sir?"

"Why did you do all this?"

"It is what's best, sir. For everyone and for you."

"I...don't...don't recite what HE would say."

"Who, sir?"

"Don't just repeat what he says - everything he says is to manipulate me - that's what this is all about!"

"Sir-"

"DON'T CALL ME SIR!"

"...Lieutenant-"

"Just...stop."

Arthur looked at the floor in silence.

"I am sorry, Peter. I never wanted any of this, but it must be done. Your story must be-"

Peter stepped forward raising his hand as he did so. Arthur abruptly went silent and shook for a brief moment. A soft popping noise and a spark came from the back of his head. His photoreceptors went dark and he slumped slightly in the chair.
