Cold, pure hatred settled in Peter's stomach and letting out a roar he summoned another blade and leapt at his former commander. Reluctantly but purposefully, she raised her sword and the blades clashed with a shower of sparks.

Soldiers and prisoners moved back as the warriors tangled. Peter began to push Bernard back with his ferocious onslaught. She steadily retreated, smoothly falling back among the wreckage of the recent battle.

There were no tactics from the aggressor, only blind rage. He ended Arthur, he ended George, he ended Lewis, he would end this war, he would end it all whatever the cost. But Bernard wouldn't go down easily.

She was more fluid and strong than he had ever seen her before. Despite the ferocity of their duel, Bernard remained consciously on the defensive. Smooth steps along the ground and little hops with boosters deftly kept her out of harms way but she never returned a blow.

Peter began lashing out with kinetic blasts and telekinetically hurling debris as his opponent. He even began rifting around her position trying anything and everything to bring her down and end the fight.

Suddenly, she skipped backwards and with a smooth boosted backflip hopped up onto a downed transport behind her out of sight. Without slowing down, Peter followed her, leaping onto the vehicle with his blade drawn back ready to strike.

To his surprise when she came back into view, she was standing with her sword at her side, her shoulder pointed towards him and looking him in the eye. He paused taken aback at her inaction and lack of guard. No mercy, just surprise at the tactic.

Before he could react or continue his halted swing, she pivoted inwards towards him, her gauntleted hand smashed into his face and everything went black.
