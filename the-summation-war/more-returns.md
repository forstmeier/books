Peter felt an overwhelming rage in his head quickly replaced by a queasiness to then immediately be supplanted by utter rage again. His shaking hands shot up and with a roar, a sword appeared, and he swung down shattering the chair and the dead husk sitting in it.

Bernard stared in surprise.

"He was a vital resource - capturing him was our whole objective."

"He's been neutralized. It'll be a greater loss to Lewis than benefit to us."

Peter was half trying to convince himself of that. Millie appeared between them staring at the dead robot on the floor.

"We're seeing reinforcements moving in now - they're responding much more quickly than expected" she said, looking up. "It looks like they expected this."

Bernard looked at Peter. "I'd say that's more than likely."

"There's something else" continued Millie. "In the last few minutes, we've received reports of broad troop movements coinciding with our attacks and they appear to be moving on our forward base."

Peter starred down at the shattered husk on the floor. Even from the grave of his late trusted servant, Lewis could strike out at him. His anger cooled immediately and he felt his stomach flip looking at Arthur's broken remains.

"There's one more thing..."

Peter turned to face her.

"A prison in northern Palestine, that recently fell within the boarders of Lewis's territory, suffered a breach today. But only a single individual escaped from custody."

A cold feeling settled in Peter's stomach.

"Alexandra More has been released."

Peter turned to stare at the remains again, numbly.

"Is she really a threat?" asked Bernard. "She was effectively insane, last I heard; she was broken after the civil war."

Millie looked at Peter as she responded to Bernard. "She's dangerous to us."

She was the first person who cared about Peter and the first to truly hurt him. Lewis was bringing her onto the field to hurt him again - an emotional weakness to play against him. Killing Arthur was capturing a rook while a pawn became a queen.

"She's headed for Jerusalem apparently looking to consolidate power there under Lewis's auspices."

A loud boom sounded outside.

"We have to go" said Bernard.

Peter didn't hear anything as the two women ushered him out of the room.

He didn't hear anything as he was hurriedly moved back out of the building.

He didn't hear anything as he was loaded back into the gunboat.

He didn't hear anything as they made a fighting retreat away from the fortress.

He didn't hear anything at all.
