The war was in its final stages. Just a week after Arthur's death, Lewis had all but completed his consolidation of power. Pockets of nations and factions still existed within his territory, both large and small, but overall Lewis had a strong hold on the situation. Those that remained outside of his control were in utter chaos.

The Federation loyalists had lost all external support for their continued offensive war to topple the regime and had turned towards defensive measures to stem the rising tide. Extraterrestrial colonies had also experienced some combat but not nearly as extensive as that seen on Earth.

Following More's release, Lewis had begun to consolidate power around Jerusalem, perhaps symbolically, with his steadily growing influence permeating the surrounding region. Immediately prior to Lewis's establishment of his headquarters there, bomb attack of unknown origin had destroyed the Temple Mount, obliterating all of the sacred sites. Officially, the attack was blamed on pro-loyalist Federation forces attempting to sow dissent among Lewis's new hegemony.

In response, Lewis promised an investigation and retaliation against those who would perform such a sacrilege. Shared anger brought the regional various factions together over the holy site's destruction. There was no doubt in the loyalists' minds that Lewis was behind the bombing - he had seized control of the ancient city by turning divisiveness into unity.

The loyalist forces were for themselves fighting on all fronts while being forced to steadily pull back. Viciousness and speed of the assaults on their positions were increasing as Lewis was likely pushing to end the conquest quickly. Nearly all emergency orders and initiatives had been executed - all contingency measures had been exhausted. They were simply running out of room and would likely be driven off world soon leaving it to gradually fall entirely under Lewis's control.

Peter had grown numb to the situation. Endless fighting, endless retreating. All he could hope to do was stem the continued bleeding.
