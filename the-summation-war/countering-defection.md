Peter was instantly alert. "He's coming here."

His three companions nodded simultaneously.

"It's going to be a small meeting" said Doyle. "George will be taking no escort and he'll be meeting with Lewis who will only be accompanied by a bodyguard squad and a small raiding company in order to disguise the defection with an assault on our outer defenses. More may also be with him."

"Do we know when?"

"Tomorrow evening" answered Bernard.

"In daylight?"

"In the evening."

"I'm going after him."

"Agreed" said Millie, "and I'm coming, too."

The quickly discussed how they would apprehend the deserter and take down Lewis and after agreeing to a plan, returned to camp to retire for the evening.

Peter couldn't sleep - he never did anymore. He just lay in bed staring at the swaying roof of the tent. There was no rest - just grim anticipation.

The next day was typical work with battle observations and plans from headquarters. Late in the afternoon, as evening began drawing in, Peter donned his combat armor quietly in his tent. He rifted to the edge of the camp where Bernard was waiting for him with her company. Her red scarf was wrapped around her neck and tucked into her suit.

"George has left the compound. He severed all communications equipment and is flying dark in the direction of the approaching force."

"Then we'll do what is necessary."

"We agreed on a capture" reminded Bernard.

"Sure."

She looked at him before turning away and mobilizing her troops. All of this was done quietly but not silently - unobtrusive to the rest of the camp which was used to seeing squads saddle up for patrols. Doyle walked over to them from the command tent.

"We're sending a commando group with you to bring in More and Lewis."

"No."

"You'll be outnumbered and Lewis will likely-"

"No, I'm going after them alone."

"I really must-"

"As Proctor I am making this my sole priority and responsibility for this mission."

"...Sir-"

Peter stared at Doyle and she broke off her objection. There was no stopping him now.

"I'll be going along, too" said Millie. She wanted to assuage Doyle's concerns even a little.

Doyle pursed her lips but acquiesced. Bernard's company deployed a few minutes later to head off the feint.
