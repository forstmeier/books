Peter was deployed with Bernard's squad to one of the flank positions that the pooled resources would be drawn from. The situation there was tenuous at best, making their feint forwards and planned withdrawal all the more convincing. They were zipped directly to the frontline of the combat zone on a gunboat, arriving shortly after the offensive began.

Peter lost himself to the frenzy of the battle. Whirling and slashing, he cut through their lines and began devastating their infantry positions. Quickly, his tactics turned from pure engagement to inflicting pain - he wanted to make his opponents suffer.

He began crushing them under objects he'd hurl telekinetically and burn them to death with lightening. Millie kept shouting over his bloodlust, desperately trying to pull him from his madness with only limited success. Then the order for retreat came and Peter reluctantly fell back.

Again, they boarded a gunboat and where whisked off towards the staging grounds for the main assault. Everything appeared to be moving according to plan but Peter barely paid any attention. He didn't care about the casualties, he just wanted to end this with Arthur; he'd doggedly pursue this to the very end. He would take this thing, this strength, from Lewis.

After a few hours their gunboat caught up with the main force which was already flying low across the planet's surface towards their target. They would hit hard and fast. It wouldn't be long before the enemy knew what they were doing but ideally they would be able to strike well before reinforcements could arrive.

Peter stood looking out over the terrain whisking by outside of the gunboat's doorway. Millie materialized next to him with a look of unease on her face - it was like she didn't know him anymore after having witnessed his fury on the battlefield.
