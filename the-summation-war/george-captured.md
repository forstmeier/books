"Ready?" asked Millie. Peter snapped his helmet into place in response. "Okay, let's go."

He kicked off from the ground and boosted away, cutting low across the darkening landscape. Millie guided him as he flew - despite George not being traceable, she was able to predict his coordinates with remarkable accuracy. He arced up and around, landing on small hill. From their vantage point, they could see a lone individual now walking briskly far off in the distance.

"I've confirmed that he is alone and we can apprehend him and move onto Lewis at this point."

The wind picked up. Peter stood and focused on George. Black smoke engulfed him in the blink of an eye as he was engulfed by his rift. A loud rushing noise followed by a snapping bang as he materialized just yards in front of from George.

The admiral stumbled backwards in shock instinctively reaching for his weapon - Peter was quicker. He shot forwards, slicing his opponent's hand off through the palm with his blade. George cried out and clutched his severed limb.

Without stopping, Peter pivoted and drove the point of his blade through the back of George's calf. Now crippled, the admiral crumpled to the ground.

"Please, please..." he gasped through the pain. Peter stood over him, retracting his helmet to show him who had brought him down.

"Mark this location so that he can retrieved later."

"Acknowledged."
