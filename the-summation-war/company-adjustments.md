Working with the company and his team came with its own challenges. After working as a hermit for so long, it was a bit of a culture shock to have to rely on and work so closely with a small, tightly-knit group of people.

They were a highly competitive group and initially regarded Peter with jealousy or disdain even but after working with him, side by side, and even being placed under his command in several training sessions, began to trust his abilities on the field and as a member of their team. And while his position as Proctor was still in effect, he was seen as a sort of "first among equals" in the company under Bernard's leadership.

While he still sought silence and solitude, whenever he could manage it, he had built a respect for his teammates and enjoyed their company. It was pulling him out of his comfort zone and developing him more than he ever expected to.

Arthur had also been separated from him upon his assignment to Bernard's squad. He was still present, assigned to the command center as an attache to Admiral George, but Peter only saw him infrequently and his training hardly allowed him time to miss his former companion.

Despite their predicament, which haunted Peter daily, the immersive nature of the training was immensely enjoyable. But time and time again, the darkness of the situation would reemerge.
