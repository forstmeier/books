---

The war was in its final stages. Just a week after Arthur's death, Lewis had all but completed his consolidation of power. Pockets of nations and factions still existed within his territory, both large and small, but overall Lewis had a strong hold on the situation. Those that remained outside of his control were in utter chaos.

The Federation loyalists had lost all external support for their continued offensive war to topple the regime and had turned towards defensive measures to stem the rising tide. Extraterrestrial colonies had also experienced some combat but not nearly as extensive as that seen on Earth.

Following More's release, Lewis had begun to consolidate power around Jerusalem, perhaps symbolically, with his steadily growing influence permeating the surrounding region. Immediately prior to Lewis's establishment of his headquarters there, bomb attack of unknown origin had destroyed the Temple Mount, obliterating all of the sacred sites. Officially, the attack was blamed on pro-loyalist Federation forces attempting to sow dissent among Lewis's new hegemony.

In response, Lewis promised an investigation and retaliation against those who would perform such a sacrilege. Shared anger brought the regional various factions together over the holy site's destruction. There was no doubt in the loyalists' minds that Lewis was behind the bombing - he had seized control of the ancient city by turning divisiveness into unity.

The loyalist forces were for themselves fighting on all fronts while being forced to steadily pull back. Viciousness and speed of the assaults on their positions were increasing as Lewis was likely pushing to end the conquest quickly. Nearly all emergency orders and initiatives had been executed - all contingency measures had been exhausted. They were simply running out of room and would likely be driven off world soon leaving it to gradually fall entirely under Lewis's control.

Peter had grown numb to the situation. Endless fighting, endless retreating. All he could hope to do was stem the continued bleeding.

He was sitting in his tent his with his hands hanging between his knees staring at nothing and trying not to focus on anything when the flap opened and Bernard entered. She was just as tired and worn - her company had sustained terrible loses leading many of the most daring counter attacks, but she continued to push on.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder at the same time.

"We've found something."

Peter rubbed his eyes. "What is it?" he said, dully.

"We can't talk here, follow me."

He followed her out into the darkness - it was well after midnight and for once there were no sounds of active combat nearby.

Bernard kept walking, straight out from the camp defensive lines. She ignited her boosters and took off; Peter followed suit. After a short while, they arrived at a large, round stone protruding from the ground with Doyle standing on top of it awaiting their arrival.

"We have a problem" said Doyle as they alighted next to her. "Millie intercepted several outbound communications and it looks like Admiral George is planning to defect."

Peter wasn't even surprised by bad news anymore. "We should arrest and execute him immediately."

"It's not that simple" interjected Millie. "I've been monitoring all enemy communications and I've been able to extrapolate Lewis's movements. And while I haven't been able to intercept all of George's communications, it appears that there's a 92% probability that he'll insist on being brought in by Lewis himself and that Lewis will have to meet him half way as a precautionary measure."

Peter was instantly alert. "He's coming here."

His three companions nodded simultaneously.

"It's going to be a small meeting" said Doyle. "George will be taking no escort and he'll be meeting with Lewis who will only be accompanied by a bodyguard squad and a small raiding company in order to disguise the defection with an assault on our outer defenses. More may also be with him."

"Do we know when?"

"Tomorrow evening" answered Bernard.

"In daylight?"

"In the evening."

"I'm going after him."

"Agreed" said Millie, "and I'm coming, too."

The quickly discussed how they would apprehend the deserter and take down Lewis and after agreeing to a plan, returned to camp to retire for the evening.

Peter couldn't sleep - he never did anymore. He just lay in bed staring at the swaying roof of the tent. There was no rest - just grim anticipation.

The next day was typical work with battle observations and plans from headquarters. Late in the afternoon, as evening began drawing in, Peter donned his combat armor quietly in his tent. He rifted to the edge of the camp where Bernard was waiting for him with her company. Her red scarf was wrapped around her neck and tucked into her suit.

"George has left the compound. He severed all communications equipment and is flying dark in the direction of the approaching force."

"Then we'll do what is necessary."

"We agreed on a capture" reminded Bernard.

"Sure."

She looked at him before turning away and mobilizing her troops. All of this was done quietly but not silently - unobtrusive to the rest of the camp which was used to seeing squads saddle up for patrols. Doyle walked over to them from the command tent.

"We're sending a commando group with you to bring in More and Lewis."

"No."

"You'll be outnumbered and Lewis will likely-"

"No, I'm going after them alone."

"I really must-"

"As Proctor I am making this my sole priority and responsibility for this mission."

"...Sir-"

Peter stared at Doyle and she broke off her objection. There was no stopping him now.

"I'll be going along, too" said Millie. She wanted to assuage Doyle's concerns even a little.

Doyle pursed her lips but acquiesced. Bernard's company deployed a few minutes later to head off the feint.

"Ready?" asked Millie. Peter snapped his helmet into place in response. "Okay, let's go."

He kicked off from the ground and boosted away, cutting low across the darkening landscape. Millie guided him as he flew - despite George not being traceable, she was able to predict his coordinates with remarkable accuracy. He arced up and around, landing on small hill. From their vantage point, they could see a lone individual now walking briskly far off in the distance.

"I've confirmed that he is alone and we can apprehend him and move onto Lewis at this point."

The wind picked up. Peter stood and focused on George. Black smoke engulfed him in the blink of an eye as he was engulfed by his rift. A loud rushing noise followed by a snapping bang as he materialized just yards in front of from George.

The admiral stumbled backwards in shock instinctively reaching for his weapon - Peter was quicker. He shot forwards, slicing his opponent's hand off through the palm with his blade. George cried out and clutched his severed limb.

Without stopping, Peter pivoted and drove the point of his blade through the back of George's calf. Now crippled, the admiral crumpled to the ground.

"Please, please..." he gasped through the pain. Peter stood over him, retracting his helmet to show him who had brought him down.

"Mark this location so that he can retrieved later."

"Acknowledged."

With a final scornful look, Peter lifted off. "Bernard's engagement began a few minutes ago - Lewis is nearby at the arranged meeting spot." Peter adjusted course per her directions shooting towards his confrontation with Lewis.

"It's coming up, on the next hill."

Peter rounded a low rise and there, in front of him, was Lewis.

He was looking out across the plain gazing in the direction of Bernard's interception operation. A heat rose in Peter's face and his vision turned a tinted rose. He let out a guttural, throat-tearing cry and increased his speed and began to partially disintegrated into a flying column of smoke.

Lewis turned to look in response to the intrusion - even now, he didn't look surprised. His bodyguards jumped forward and quickly opened fire on the approaching War Proctor. Before they could pick him off he rifted without slowing his pace right into the middle of their contingent.

Whirling, orange-golden blurs from his blade immediately struck down two guards while simultaneously disarming Lewis's quickly brandished weapon. Peter flicked off a shot from his pistol, striking Lewis in the chest, spinning him, and with a grunt, he fell to the ground.

The remaining guards converged, their blades flying. Peter jumped and spun, rapidly engaging and killing another before delivering a telekinetic blast to another shattering his body and sending his corpse flying. A blade slashed at Peter's head - he ducked, whirled, and impaled the remaining opponent through the chest. Pushing him off his blade, Peter stood to survey the scene which had unfolded in a matter of seconds.

Pure fury fueled Peter's ferocity. He turned to face the now kneeling Lewis - he was badly injured, possibly critically. Peter stood over him, brandishing his pistol.

"I, Peter, Proctor of the Federation of Pangea" spoke Peter, "in this battlefield tribunal, convened by me and chaired by myself alone, charge you with state terrorism, insurrection, instigating war, political repression, and crimes against humanity. I find you guilty on all charges and sentence you to death. Before carrying out the sentence, do you have anything further to say?"

Lewis looked up at him, his breathing labored and blood dripping from his mouth. His eyes, however, were as focused and steely as ever. It was the first time the two of them had met face-to-face, or even had a direct interaction, since before the beginning of the war.

"I wasn't sure that you had it in you - the ability to let yourself go and do whatever it takes, to sacrifice yourself to save the world. You're so close, so close...but will you be able to rescue yourself on the other side?"

Peter paused for a brief moment. And then squeezed the trigger. Lewis slumped sideways.

He was dead.

Peter felt no satisfaction. His weapons hung loosely at his sides; he was tired and numb. Then a cold rage began settling into his bones. Rage at what Lewis had done and his arrogance even up to the end. His will to destroy the world and everything in it.

Peter rifted away and stepped onto a battlefield. It was where Bernard had intercepted the attack - the fighting was over but the battle scars were still brutally fresh. Equipment burned; smoke and ash was everywhere; the dead were littered around.

Peter rifted up to a low rise between two large hills and looked down into the valley. Infantry of Lewis's attack team were falling back on foot. A long-barreled pistol materialized in Peter's hand and he took aim at the retreating figures. He began to calmly and methodically squeeze off shot after shot after shot dropping the targets one by one.

Some turned to fire back at their assailant but his fire was too precise to allow an effective counter. Bernard flew up behind him and quickly took in the scene as Millie materialized over his shoulder.

"Peter, stop" she said quietly. He continued taking shots, ignoring her. Bernard stepped forward pushing his extended arm up, halting his persistent, steady rain of death.

"They're retreating - killing them is unnecessary. Lewis?"

"Dead."

"George?"

"Down."

"Okay. We need to return to base; we captured several soldiers from the assault convoy and are preparing to transport them back to camp."

Peter turned away, shaking off Bernard's hand and stalked down the hill towards the group of captured soldiers. He walked right up to one of the men at the front of the group, on his knees with his hands shackled behind his back - he didn't raise his eyes as Peter approached.

"Execute them" he said as he looked down at the man before him. The soldier straightened in surprise, looking up into Peter's calm face.

"What?" asked Millie incredulously.

"You heard me. Execute them."

"We can't do that - they're prisoners of war!"

"You will do as you are ordered" he called over to the soldiers behind him, ignoring Millie's protests.

"Peter, this goes against the rules of engagement - this is a criminal act!"

"DO IT!" screamed Peter at the nearest officer.

The soldiers hesitated and a fury flew up in Peter's heart as turned and saw their uncertainty. Letting out a roar, a sword appeared in his hand and with a whirl he chopped down towards the kneeling soldier's head.

A blur flew between them and Peter's sword blade spun away, harmlessly deflected from its intended target. Peter caught his balance and looked down at his hand which was now only gripping the hilt of his destroyed weapon. It had been cleanly cut below the guard but above his hand.

He spun to see Bernard standing with her blade drawn, hanging loosely at her side. She had shot forwards and intercepted his blow, precisely cutting the weapon out of his hand.

"I will not allow you to do that" she said calmly.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder. With a sad look she disappeared and then reappeared over Bernard's shoulder before disappearing again. She had changed her allegiance.

Cold, pure hatred settled in Peter's stomach and letting out a roar he summoned another blade and leapt at his former commander. Reluctantly but purposefully, she raised her sword and the blades clashed with a shower of sparks.

Soldiers and prisoners moved back as the warriors tangled. Peter began to push Bernard back with his ferocious onslaught. She steadily retreated, smoothly falling back among the wreckage of the recent battle.

There were no tactics from the aggressor, only blind rage. He ended Arthur, he ended George, he ended Lewis, he would end this war, he would end it all whatever the cost. But Bernard wouldn't go down easily.

She was more fluid and strong than he had ever seen her before. Despite the ferocity of their duel, Bernard remained consciously on the defensive. Smooth steps along the ground and little hops with boosters deftly kept her out of harms way but she never returned a blow.

Peter began lashing out with kinetic blasts and telekinetically hurling debris as his opponent. He even began rifting around her position trying anything and everything to bring her down and end the fight.

Suddenly, she skipped backwards and with a smooth boosted backflip hopped up onto a downed transport behind her out of sight. Without slowing down, Peter followed her, leaping onto the vehicle with his blade drawn back ready to strike.

To his surprise when she came back into view, she was standing with her sword at her side, her shoulder pointed towards him and looking him in the eye. He paused taken aback at her inaction and lack of guard. No mercy, just surprise at the tactic.

Before he could react or continue his halted swing, she pivoted inwards towards him, her gauntleted hand smashed into his face and everything went black.
