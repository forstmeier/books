Sunrise greeted the group as they awoke and went about a quick breakfast. After gathering a few things for the trip the two humans and their two artificial companions boarded the skiff and set off for Port Sendler. It was more small and compact, rather functionally industrial in its layout, but served its purpose well. Not that it mattered as there was little time for sightseeing.

They boarded their ship and were off for the Federation lunar base which had been heavily terraformed since Peter's last visit. It had only been a few months since his last departure from _Pangea_, when he had gone to inspect a project with Lewis, but its scale still amazed him when he could get a global view himself. The entire outer shell of the construct had been completely terraformed providing the basic framework for natural life to flourish.

Much still needed to be refined and populated, but the essentials were there. A new world waiting to be discovered.

The flight to the lunar base was short and Peter spent the time alone with his thoughts on the observation deck. Maybe not in thought, but thinking about nothing.

A great sliver of grey-white appeared before the ship as the half-shadowed lunar body came closer. Surrounding the visible landscape was a faintly glowing blue halo - the first indicator that this was no longer the ancient, silent moon of generations past. Substantial coordinated efforts by dozens of organizations, including the Federation of Pangea, had undertaken the massive task of terraforming the Earth's closest neighbor. The project had begun immediately prior to Peter's ascent to the Proctorship and it had made great strides in creating a habitable atmosphere and terrain for the _homo sapiens_ looking to make it a second home.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder, voicing his silent thoughts. "They've made incredible progress" she said, pointing out towards the landscape, "there's still much more that can be seeded with fauna. It's not the same problem they had building _Pangea_; in some respects, this one seems harder since it's a framework we didn't create ourselves."
