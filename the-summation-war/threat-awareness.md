Peter stiffened.

After the ITAM civil war he had worked closely with Lewis who had been vindicated and mostly socially rehabilitated following the war, although many still treated him with some distrust due to his allowing the war to occur at all. Over time, Peter learned to work with him and the pair enjoyed a good working, professional relationship. They met relatively often in person and Lewis was the one exception to Peter's self-impose hermitage away from the rest of humanity.

In return, Lewis brought Peter off world on visits to the various astrological and astronautical projects underway. It was a a master-apprentice relationship of sorts. Not personal friends, but close nonetheless.

Sometime ago, Lewis had become more hands-off in his approach, letting Peter work on his own. However, this now struck the Proctor as an odd coincidence with the beginnings of the first occurrences of the rumblings they were now discussing. His stomach lurched at the prospect of potential treachery from his greatest teacher; he certainly hoped that this were not the case but he knew the extent of Lewis's abilities and the opacity of his nature.

Millie gave him a guarded look, not wanting to share what she knew in front of Doyle.

"Regardless, a serious situation appears to be unfolding and I've brought the results of our intelligence gathering for you to review. This conspiracy appears to go well beyond Federation boundaries, bleeding into other natural entities and countries. Beyond the Federation, greater humanity is at risk of war."

She handed Peter a small datafile which he briefly opened and began absorbing and processing in the background while they talked. Everything fit with what Doyle had just told them. Doyle looked a bit uncomfortable, aware of the awkward request she was making of the Proctor.

"We need you to head off the threat, to address it directly. We need your direct involvement in this situation."
