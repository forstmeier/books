Rumblings were steadily growing around Lewis's potential, future moves. Headlines and announcements across the world continued to point towards an inevitable conflict. Disparate factions were rising in several countries, calling for overthrows, often violently, of established governments.

External support for the Federation was rapidly falling away leaving increasingly reduced ability for the nation to defend itself. No war declaration against the Federation was forthcoming, but the increased mobilization of soldiers and weapons indicated it was not far off. A number of small skirmishes had occurred as Lewis's forces probed defensive capabilities and made forays into loyalist territory to seize supplies.
