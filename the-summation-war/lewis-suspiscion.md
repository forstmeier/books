"Well" said Doyle as she leaned back in her chair "your "exile" doesn't seem to have prevented you from keeping yourself well-rounded and knowledgeable."

"I'm always curious."

"A good trait to have. I expect it has also made you aware of the rumblings - the reason for my visit?"

Peter was silent for a moment.

"Not rumblings per se, but there is something stirring in the network and I haven't been able to put my finger on what it is. Something's shifting under the surface, outside of our direction."

Millie, who had been listening to the conversation, chimed in, "I've noticed odd patterns appearing in the data. Increased inbound requests to the network and what looks like some sort of redundant information and resource siloing occurring but it's unclear as to why or who is directing it. The directives appear to be emanating in a distributed manner."

Doyle sat forward, her focus affirming the others' suspicions.

"And there are rumors. More than rumors, steadily growing and of a disturbing nature."

She leaned in even further, heightening the conspiratorial tone.

"There are the beginnings of a coup. Splinter groups within the Federation are planning on wresting control of the organization as a whole through whatever regulatory, legislative, or physical means necessary. The danger of Federation network and resources falling into misguided hands is increasing."

"Should this organization fall away from its intrinsic, core mission, the result would be a calamity the likes of which we have never seen before - but I suppose the two of you know that better than anyone ever could. All of our work, your work, could be undone in the blink of an eye."
