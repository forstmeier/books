Sirens blared out and the control room burst into chaos.

"Assembly the company in the hanger" barked Bernard.

Millie appeared over Peter's shoulder; "On it" she confirmed quickly before disappearing again. "Let's go" and the two sprinted out and down the hallways. From outside, muffled explosions and weapons fire could be heard.

Bursting into the hanger, they could see the rest of the company rapidly suiting up. He ran over and quickly donned his armor suit before scrambling into his Big and securing the cockpit around him.

Bernard's voice crackled through the shared team communications channel. "We have intel coming in regarding the attacking force. It consists of several heavy cruisers but they've chosen to primarily deploy ground forces against the base. Several regiments of infantry with heavy mechanized support and a cluster of artillery divisions. From the looks of it, they're here to seize the base rather than destroy it outright."

To Peter what that meant is that they were here for him, to capture him.

"We're going to hit them fast and hard, specifically we'll target their heavy weaponry and put the vanguard on its heels. Platoon 1, that's you with me."

"Yes ma'am" said Peter.

"Platoons 2 and 3, you'll be providing a triage defense to allow our ground forces to establish their own defenses."

"Yes, ma'am" came the affirmative over the intercom.
