Millie appeared in the air next to them, "Back to headquarters, now!"

"What is it?"

"You'll see - move!"

The pair sprinted off towards the center of the compound. They dashed into the war room again filled with officers looking solemn.

Another hologram of Lewis stood over the middle of the table. Again, Peter stepped forward and activated it with a wave of his hand and the message began to play.

"As per my previously stated intentions, which are known and open, I am attempting to work in ITAM & Co.'s best interests with all that I do. Today, minority interest of outstanding shares of the state entity Federation Holdings, formerly ITAM & Co., was purchased by my subsidiary, Carthago Capital. This interest, alongside the collective minority stakes held by a private syndicate, has established a controlling stake in the company operations."

A list briefly flashed before them displaying the list of owners.

"We are ordering the immediate dismissal of the board of directors, disarmament of all Federation of Pangea forces, and the arrest of the Proctor. A global announcement to this affect has been made and further announcements will be made at a later time concerning the future of ITAM & Co."

The hologram flicked off.

Peter looked to Doyle.

"We need to stop this" he said.

"Agreed. There have been no communications from the board of directors. It is likely that they were complicit with this move by Lewis."

Bustling resumed around them in the command room as officers began to move to prove the veracity of Lewis's statements.

Doyle ushered Peter over to a separate desk cluster.

"We'll establish a unit to do whatever is necessary to interface with the loyalists within the business units to halt this move if possible."

Peter nodded. Nothing good could come from this grab for power. It was a clear and immediate escalation of their conflict - an alarming situation.
