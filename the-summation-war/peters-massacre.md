He was dead.

Peter felt no satisfaction. His weapons hung loosely at his sides; he was tired and numb. Then a cold rage began settling into his bones. Rage at what Lewis had done and his arrogance even up to the end. His will to destroy the world and everything in it.

Peter rifted away and stepped onto a battlefield. It was where Bernard had intercepted the attack - the fighting was over but the battle scars were still brutally fresh. Equipment burned; smoke and ash was everywhere; the dead were littered around.

Peter rifted up to a low rise between two large hills and looked down into the valley. Infantry of Lewis's attack team were falling back on foot. A long-barreled pistol materialized in Peter's hand and he took aim at the retreating figures. He began to calmly and methodically squeeze off shot after shot after shot dropping the targets one by one.

Some turned to fire back at their assailant but his fire was too precise to allow an effective counter. Bernard flew up behind him and quickly took in the scene as Millie materialized over his shoulder.

"Peter, stop" she said quietly. He continued taking shots, ignoring her. Bernard stepped forward pushing his extended arm up, halting his persistent, steady rain of death.

"They're retreating - killing them is unnecessary. Lewis?"

"Dead."

"George?"

"Down."

"Okay. We need to return to base; we captured several soldiers from the assault convoy and are preparing to transport them back to camp."
