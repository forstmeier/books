The ship dove towards the moon, zeroing in on one of the many installations scattered across the surface. Some cities appeared to be industrial operations while others looked more like farming or trading posts; all bore similar, sleek metallic designs befitting their extraterrestrial location. Towers rose up, more narrow than those on Earth due to the gravity manipulations on the lunar surface.

They swooped down towards a large collection of low buildings embedded into the ground and dropped into a sunken docking bay. The base had a practical feel but still maintained a sleek and beautiful exterior in common with the rest of the lunar buildings. Pivoting on its tail, their ship gracefully slid into a floating dock part of a circular port containing a variety of other large vessels.

As their party disembarked to the walkway surrounding the dock, armed personnel could be seen monitoring checkpoints and inspecting incoming ships. "We're not on _Pangea_ anymore" whispered Millie's voice in Peter's ear.

They followed Doyle out into a paved courtyard surrounded by small, well-kept sloping green lawns and into an adjacent building. Down hallways and through several checkpoints, they eventually came to what was clearly a war room. Large holograms displaying maps and figures were everywhere and glowing tables displayed fleets and weaponry. Individuals moved about dressed in military uniforms or full combat load out. Robots were similarly outfitted in martial attire; even the holographic AI wore armor.

"Do you think they're planning anything?" asked Millie sarcastically.
