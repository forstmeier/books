Arthur found his way through the bustle to Peter and Doyle.

"Sir, I believe I've found something important."

"What is it?"

Arthur activated a hologram which showed a large chart with hundreds of elements and connecting lines making it look like something out of a conspiracy theorist's wall.

"With that announcement, and based off of the list that Lewis disclosed, it has confirmed the pattern we have observed in recent months. Approximately 58% of all liquidations, business divestures, external acquisitions, employment decision, and corporate strategy in the prior three months flowed through a resource directly held by Lewis. The remaining 42% of all actions flowed through these resources indirectly held by Lewis."

The queasy feeling returned.

"He's been planning this for a very long time and taken steps to prepare his exact footing before he launched himself down this path. That announcement was just an attempt to bully us into submission and make us look weak publicly."

"He fully expects war. He wants it now."

The bustle around them had increased. A staffer ran over to Doyle.

"Ma'am, there are reports coming in from across our holdings - a large-scale defection is underway."

Another shouted "Ma'am! We're receiving reports of coordinated attacks on our positions!"

A claxon sounded overhead.

"ALL PERSONNEL: BATTLE STATIONS THIS IS NOT A DRILL REPEAT BATTLE STATIONS THIS IS NOT A DRILL"

Doyle and Peter shared a look. The opening moves were over. They were officially in the middle of the game.
