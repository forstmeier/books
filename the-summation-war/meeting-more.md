Loyalist ships poured into the opening and pushing back against the broken enemy lines that had swung in to pincer them as they passed through. Peter flew through the burning debris, striking out at active combatants as he lead the charge.

In a few moments, he burst through the initial defensive lines, followed closely by the rest of the fleet, and dove towards the ancient city. Ground troops disembarked as the shock troopers launched forwards. Peter threw himself into hand-to-hand combat against the enemy becoming a solo fighting whirlwind before the rest of the company caught up to his position. They battled through the streets, making their way towards where intelligence had placed the headquarters and More.

A figure rifted onto a roof above Peter. It was More standing arms akimbo dressed in battle armor - the image was so similar to the last time they had met in battle. But her hair was how somewhat disheveled and there was a look of chaos in her eyes. She was full tilt.

No longer was she the compassionate woman who had welcomed Peter into this world. She was now solely bent on achieving her ends - no matter the cost to herself or to others.

Peter turned to face her and jetted up onto the roof a short distance away.
