The group continued discussing unfolding situation and observing the reports as they came in. It soon became apparent that separatist forces had played a direct role in several of the power grabs; the separatist factions under Lewis were the connection, the spark, behind and a part of the entire unfolding cataclysm. Some of the newly established governments launched assaults on their neighbors and the face of the planet became engulfed in war.

But within that chaos, a pattern was beginning to emerge. Coalitions, alliances, overthrows, conflicts, and conquests, all falling into place like dominoes. George's concern was validated. Indirectly or directly, Lewis was becoming the center of a global superpower.

And then it came.

The splinter faction of the Federation reformed itself as the Administrative Union and immediately following this was an announcement from its newly-formed Office of the Secretary with Lewis holding the Secretary's position. While the violence and conflict was softly condemned, it was regarded as a necessary action to unify the world under a new coalition government with the Union serving as its de facto head. As part of the required steps for stabilization, all rival and unbending factions would be brought to heel by force if necessary.

It was now clear to the observers in the command center that moves against the Federation early on were intended to destabilize one of the major obstacles towards achieving this goal. After the announcement, reports came in of several major defections occurring among the loyalists' ranks. Loyalists were bristling and skirmishes broke out as defectors attempted to make off with resources and weapons.

Lines were rapidly being drawn and the loyalists were already badly outgunned. War was now upon them.
