"There's an incoming transmission from General Doyle."

Peter nodded and extended his upturned hand to display the message. Doyle appeared in his palm, fully equipped in a bulky suit of armor.

"The plan appears to be unfolding within the acceptable parameters. We're actively monitoring communications and there's nothing out of the ordinary to indicate that they've picked up on our movements as of yet. Our buildup may have gone unnoticed with the two peripheral "victories" happening simultaneously."

Peter nodded in grim satisfaction.

"What is the status of mobilization?" asked Millie.

"Nearly complete - your contingent should be at full force in the next half hour."

Bernard stepped into the hanger as Doyle's image disappeared. "You'll be leading the assault on the outer post."

Peter stiffened.

"Not the main base?"

Bernard shook her head.

"What? Why not?!" he asked furiously.

"Because you have been ordered to do so."

"Captain-"

"Silence, soldier!" barked Bernard. Peter instinctively came to attention and fell silent but still fuming on the inside. Bernard stepped forward, looking into his eyes while he stared straight ahead.

"We're in an active combat zone and I have tactical command - you will obey these orders or risk court martial - do you understand?"

"Yes, ma'am" muttered Peter reluctantly.

She clearly didn't want him engaging Arthur directly after having witnessed his conduct on the feint operation.
