Peter's eyes opened. He was in a clean, white environment laying on a gurney dressed in a medical gown.

Memories came flooding back - all of them. Arthur's betrayal and Arthur's death. George's betrayal and George's capture. Lewis's betrayal and Lewis's execution. Bernard's defiance and their duel.

All came rushing back in but none of the anger, just a cold sickness in the pit of his stomach. He curled into a ball on his side thinking of what had been done, thinking of what he had done and what he had tried to do. There was no more outward anger, no more hatred, just self-loathing and a deep sadness. A deep, unrelenting sadness.

He curled tighter on the bed trying to force the images from his mind. The door to the medical bay slid open and in walked Bernard. Peter quickly rolled to the other side facing away from her but felt her approach the bed and sit on the edge.

His throat clenched up and he sobbed into the blanket. A few moments passed as he cried quietly.

"I failed you all" he sniffed.

There was a brief pause and Bernard responded, "It wasn't just that you failed us - you failed yourself." Peter scrunched tighter but knew the words were true. "You stand for something more; you represent what is good and what can be. You represent the good that we could do for this world and our responsibility in it."

His throat tightened again - he couldn't bear to look at her.

"But you're also just a man."

Again he sobbed.

"A man with faults, misdeeds, errors in judgment...failures." He sniffled and wiped his eyes without turning. "No matter what you do or how good you are, you will always fall. We all shall fall." Peter took a deep, raspy breath.

Mustering up the courage, he finally rolled over to face Bernard with his tear-streaked, red-eyed countenance.

"We all shall fall."

Millie appeared over Bernard's shoulder. "What matters is that we get back up again."

Peter sat up and shook his head slowly. "I...I can't. I've lost too much; I've cost us too much."

He curled into a ball holding his stomach, the full weight of his actions still bearing down on him. It hurt thinking of those he had hurt.

"Yes, you can" said Millie. "And you must do it yourself for your own redemption."

He looked down at the floor without responding.

"Come back to us, Peter" said Bernard. She was truly calling him back - back from out of the abyss. For a few moments he sat thinking silently.

"We know your burden. We forgive you, Peter" said Millie. He looked up into their eyes. Millie and Bernard. They gazed on him with a calm intent and impossible patience. Like a family bringing in a wayward son.

He took another deep breath. "But what can I do? I've all but lost this war against us. I've lost the respect of the soldiers under my command. I sacrificed our greatest sources of insight into the enemy's plans. I've lost us everything." Again, he closed his eyes and turned his head down and away from their gaze.

"You can admit your faults, accept responsibility, pick yourself up, and lead us again" said Millie.

He looked back at her. "Lead you?"

"As Field Marshal."

A surprised look flew over Peter's face. "W-what?"

"General Doyle pushed for it. She recommended it for the endgame which would provide us with a strong, central figurehead. Someone who could defeat Lewis and who can defeat himself."

"I executed him."

"You did what was necessary" interjected Millie. "He was absolutely too dangerous to be kept alive."

"Especially with More back on the battlefield" chimed in Bernard. "She has seized control of field operations with Lewis now gone and is pressing hard on Jerusalem."

"We believe that she is looking to cement her hold and strategic position so we must break her before it can be established."

Again, Peter looked down at the floor. He heard the buzz of a hologram fizzle into existence.

"Hello, Peter."

Looking up, there stood an image of the late former chairman. He was clad in battle armor and dark robes - not unlike those Peter had last seen him in.

"This final message is to you, specifically. This is the story that is being written for you, the Proctor. It is another of the long string of great burdens that I am sorry to have placed upon your shoulders. But that is why I am leaving this message for you now."

"This war I have created is needed. In order to draw out the evil in the world and across the globe, it needed to be given the opportunity to rise to the surface. It was to draw out those who would seek to oppress and destroy their fellow man and unite them under a single name. Mine."

"My actions are inexcusable - a necessary evil but one that is unforgivable. I am throwing away my soul for the world and I do not hope to find it again. If you are watching this, then you have already killed me but even so I do not know that you will win. I have released a great terror on the world and your only task is to see that it does not come to full fruition."

"Your greatest accomplishment will always be the good you choose to do with the time given to you in this world. No parent is proud of their child for their child's sake - they are proud of who they become."

The hologram disappeared and Peter looked down again briefly before raising his gaze to meet the two women before him. A renewed sense of purpose filled his body.

"I cannot erase my past, but I can try to rise above it."

Both nodded with satisfaction.

Shortly after he was discharged from the medical bay and formally assumed his role as Field Marshal. Doyle had arranged that he give a speech to the loyalist forces - all those spread across the planet and in the heavens.

In the little dark broadcast room alone, he knew that his voice would be sounded across planets and into the farthest reaches of the Federation's outposts.

"Our world has been thrown into total war" he spoke into the microphone before him. "This is not a war of conquest - it is a war of all against all. A summation war. A conflict that seeks to sweep freedom from this world and cast us into oblivion."

"But those of us who are now yet left to fight it, receive the greatest gift: to rise above. To rise and stand against it. For when the darkness looms, the light must shine back against it. And that is what we are called to do today."

"Wrong is still wrong, even if everyone is. Right is still right, even if no one is. Our battle will soon begin and even as we stand before it commences, we are victorious."

The microphone shut off and Bernard and Doyle entered with Millie hovering over the captain's shoulder. Millie disappeared briefly and then reappeared next to Peter, resuming her position alongside the Proctor. She smiled him and finally Peter smiled back.

Rapid preparations followed for the coming engagement which would take the form of an all-out assault on Jerusalem, the now de facto head of the insurgency operations.

Peter suited himself in a full set of heavier armor all white and gray with several small wing-like appendages from its upper arms and back. The call went out to all forces to abandon posts and make a final slicing run at the opposition leadership position. Cut off the head of the serpent.

Loyalist ships convened in low orbit as the enemy ships similarly positioned themselves defensively around the outskirts of Jerusalem. There was a bustle of activity on the ship's bridge as Peter looked on. This would be a one final run to bring down the enemy - do or die.

The charge brought the loyalist forces to rapidly close the gap with the enemy. And then it began.

Ships began firing across the dwindling gap at one another. The bridge shook as they came under fire. Peter looked out at the blue sky around them and the world down below as the two fleets ignited above it all.

He left the bridge and quickly loaded into a gunboat alongside others who would be serving as a forward shock trooper entry. They dropped from the belly of the capital ship and shot out across the expanse between the fleets - other ships could be seen doing the same. It was imperative that they take this battle to the ground wherever the leadership, More, was.

Peter opened a channel to all ship commanders. "Prepare to fire missiles on my mark." They would punch their way through.

"Open hatch!" he ordered to the gunboat crew. It swung open and Peter had to brace himself against the rushing wind. Stepping to the door he paused for a brief moment before jumping out into thin air. Activating his jetpack, he moved out ahead of the charging gunboat.

"All ships, fire!"

Behind him, the entire fleet fired their missiles simultaneously across at their enemies. They were still too far to make the missiles particularly effective as they could mostly be intercepted before reaching their desired targets - so Peter needed to get them closer. Reaching out, he could feel Millie helping him to focus and expand his power. He began to partially rift, leaving a trail of smoke, as he flew through the atmosphere.

In a split second, he expanded the points of the rift to encompass each of the flying missiles. And then, in rapid succession, they materialized around him in a rushing storm of fire like a flock of thundering phoenixes. The enemy couldn't have predicted this and were now vulnerable to the focused swarm of destruction.

At the last moment, Peter threw the missiles ahead forming a vortex around him just before they slammed into the enemy. Capital ships were torn apart and consumed in enormous fireballs before their hulking wrecks fell from the sky. The ploy had worked and a crack had been made in the enemy's lines which they could wedge their attack through.

Loyalist ships poured into the opening and pushing back against the broken enemy lines that had swung in to pincer them as they passed through. Peter flew through the burning debris, striking out at active combatants as he lead the charge.

In a few moments, he burst through the initial defensive lines, followed closely by the rest of the fleet, and dove towards the ancient city. Ground troops disembarked as the shock troopers launched forwards. Peter threw himself into hand-to-hand combat against the enemy becoming a solo fighting whirlwind before the rest of the company caught up to his position. They battled through the streets, making their way towards where intelligence had placed the headquarters and More.

A figure rifted onto a roof above Peter. It was More standing arms akimbo dressed in battle armor - the image was so similar to the last time they had met in battle. But her hair was how somewhat disheveled and there was a look of chaos in her eyes. She was full tilt.

No longer was she the compassionate woman who had welcomed Peter into this world. She was now solely bent on achieving her ends - no matter the cost to herself or to others.

Peter turned to face her and jetted up onto the roof a short distance away.

"So here we are again, face to face in war" said More in a sarcastic tone.

"I'm here to end this" responded Peter.

"So many wars to be fought over a single individual" she snorted. "All of this blood for you. How does it feel to know you are the cause of all of this pain and misery?"

She gestured wide out to the city engulfed in battle around them. Nearby ships exchanged fire overhead with smaller fighters dogfighting between them. Everywhere there was destruction. Peter had only seen the peripheral of the last war - this one was up close and personal.

"It is a call for me to serve."

"This is what you want to bring to this world? This is what you offer?"

"I offer an end. I offer life."

"There is no end, not while there is still suffering in this world and now that my chains are broken, I will end it once and for all." She raised her blade point towards Peter and he raised his own in response.

Both duelists jetted forwards and their blades met. Slash, parry, blow, block, chop, evade. The combatants whirled with their blades dancing in deadly harmony. Leaping and jetting, tooth and claw, as the world burned around them.

A battle within and a battle without.

But through it all, Peter was calm - centered and whole. He was grounded in the knowledge that what he was doing was right; what he was doing was what he was called to do. He would put down his own life to ensure that the mission was carried through and to bring this tyranny down.

The two fighters were surprisingly evenly match and More knew this. She broke off their struggle and leaping backwards she looked to the sky above.

A small loyalist capital ship was sailing low over the city. More raised her hand towards it and little holograms danced around her hand. One and then two opposition fighters abruptly slammed into its aft section destroying its shields and propulsion systems.

The ship began to fall towards the city below, much of which had not been evacuated prior to the battle meaning the crash would be the death of hundreds of innocents. Peter threw his sword from his hands and stepped forwards towards the falling vessel. Millie materialized next to him and both raised their arms in unison.

Like twin Atlases carrying the world, they reached out towards the falling vessel and caught it with a kinetic field. It was a massive weight and it took all of their focus to keep it afloat. And in doing so, Peter made himself utterly vulnerable to his opponent.

He knew it, More knew it. She leaped forward with her blade brandished and whipped it upwards.

He felt his arm spin away cut cleanly just below the elbow but he didn't flinch. He continued focusing on the ship steadily moving it towards an empty square that it could be put down in.

Even now, More couldn't kill him outright, at least not immediately. Perhaps there was some good left in her after all. But she would still see the job done, even if it pained her greatly.

She drew her blade back again, this time prepared to deliver the final blow.

A quick flash of red flew by a blade met More's causing her to spin away to recover her balance.

There stood Bernard clad in armor and a war kilt - she raised her blade in salute before smoothly running forward to engage More. The now-maimed Peter continued directing the falling ship but could see the two women battling out of the corner of his eye.

More was fighting fiercely with a savage look in her eyes. Bernard was calm as ever but moved with great intent and agency - she would end her opponent here and now. The two dueled ferociously but More was quickly losing ground.

Swiftly, Bernard sidestepped a strike and spun bringing her blade down hard on More's blade driving it from her hand. Without stopping she spun and drove her sword clean through More's torso.

More gasped in shock as she felt the mortal blow strike home. Bernard quickly withdrew the blade and stepped away from her defeated opponent. Instinctively, More's hand went to her wound before falling to her knees and rolling onto her side.

Peter finally managed to set the ship down and quickly went to More's side. He rolled her onto his knees and cradled her head in his hands.

"No...no...no..." whispered More feverishly.

"Shhhhh, don't. Just rest. Don't worry."

"I...need to...go..." She closed her eyes and died. Peter bowed his head at the loss of life, the woman who had once loved him dearly and who he still loved like family.

"You're hurt" said Bernard from behind him. Peter looked down at the stump where his hand used to be.

"We need to go."

Peter nodded in agreement as Bernard stepped forward to help guide him off. Suddenly a series of explosions blew apart houses nearby. They looked up to see opposition capital ships beginning to open fire on the city and surrounding ships indiscriminately. A smaller ship veered downwards and slammed into the skyline.

Millie appeared and consulting scrolling data in front of her she said "More activated a deadman switch. It activated an override program on all opposition weaponry and vehicles. From the looks of it, it's designed to have all forces encircle the city and destroy everything in it including themselves."

Peter gazed upwards - the pitch of the battle above had become much more destructive - fire and carnage was everywhere. The city of heaven surrounded by hell.

"No." His companions looked at him. "We won't let that happen."

Millie turned back to the scrolling data before her searching the networks for information.

"Got it." She threw a map up for the others to see. "We can piggyback onto her override and seize control of their equipment, ending the self-destruct and the battle itself. We need to get to the headquarters, here" she said pointing to the map where a little red dot had appeared. "I would be able to connect into the system from that central location."

"Okay. Let's go."

The two took off running across the city rooftops with Bernard leading the way. Peter was able to keep up but was hindered in his ability to fight with his missing arm. Bernard more than compensated for his loss.

Millie materialized over peter's shoulder. "The self-destruct is starting to pilot ships into the city on suicide runs! We need to rift it all, rift the city! We need to save the inhabitants!"

"Where?"

"I'll handle it!"

Peter again cast away the sword he had been defending himself with and moved to run closely in Bernard's wake of destruction. A massive swirling sandstorm kicked up around them as Peter and Millie began to defend the city. Rifts summoned by Peter began to consume the city within the storm and shields sporadically rose around them to deflect incoming blasts while they ran. Chaos grew to unimaginable levels as buildings and blocks began to disappear in turmoil and dark smoke.

As they arrived at the perimeter of the headquarters several enemy shoulders rifted near them and leaped in to attack.

"Go!" shouted Bernard. "I'll hold them off!" And with that she whirled off to intercept the attackers. Without breaking stride she jumped down from the rooftop to ground level into an alleyway to engage the enemy.

As he continued to run, everything began to become hazy to Peter. The energy, focus, effort, pain, drive, exhaustion, sorrow, and loss all began to wash over him, hitting him all at once. Swamped with guilt, swamped with agony.

His sprint became a stagger as he approached the headquarters building Millie had marked. The storm surrounding them rose in pitch - tearing at the very fabric of the world as Peter lost himself totally to the power. He stumbled forwards and throwing a kinetic blast, blew the small entrance door from its hinges.

Everything was blurry and vague before his eyes and he barely made it through the doorway. He felt himself instinctively release a torrent of lightening on the oncoming sentries before he fell to his knees.

He crawled forward and heard Millie calling out in his ear but it was like she was miles away. He crawled forward not knowing where he was going before slumping forward onto the ground. He reached out his hand as far as he could and with what energy he had left he reached out and felt a small click in the back of his mind before the world sank into darkness.

_Epilogue_

Before he collapsed from fatigue, Peter was able to connect Millie with the opposition's central system and she successfully seized control over the broad majority of equipment and resources ending the battle and effectively ending the war. Several holdouts remained across Earth and several off-Earth colonies had managed to solidify their holdings following the uprising but their influence was contained.

Lewis's ploy had been successful in pulling to the top the most dangerous factions of the world and defeating the vast majority of them in one fell swoop. However, this information was never made public, and Lewis's actions were widely condemned by the world community.

Peter, in his role as Proctor over the reunited ITAM, began setting about to dismantle the sphere of influence of the organization and instead focus on building a true landless nation named the Republic of Reliquia. With this new status, the Reliquian nation began focusing on establishing independent, collaborative projects with other nations and entities rather than dictating large-scale operations.

Jerusalem had been all but entirely destroyed in the final major engagement of the war with an astounding loss of life from all parties involved with More's deadman switch being the primary culprit in this regard. Peter's final actions in rifting the city managed to save most lives there and Millie had guided all of the rifted resources to _Pangea_ somewhat intact. While many historic resources were returned to Jerusalem after the war, some were kept on _Pangea_ to truly become a "kingdom of the heavens."

Another recording from Lewis was later discovered by Millie in his private journals. It read:

"We are still in the era of enemies but one day perhaps we will be brothers all. Until then, we will need someone to find the demons in our midst and I do not ask for a pardon for what I have done. These atrocities and unforgivable acts I have committed were done because they were what was needed, not what was right."

"Greater humanity needed this from me: my own humanity. No one should make this decision again and I hope that you all go on to be better."
