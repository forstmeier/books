It was cool in Peter's office.

The space was relatively small but comfortable and functional. Dozens of screens and holographic readouts lined the plaster walls in a paradoxically orderly chaos. Recessed lights in the ceiling gave off a soft illumination complementing the cool glow of the monitors. Situated in the center of it all was a desk upon which sat several more monitors and a keyboard. The rugs beneath his feet were thick and provided a splash of color.

Peter liked it; his office provided a place to think and to work without distraction.

It had been nearly ten years since he had ascended to the Proctorship role. And over that time, he had overseen a heavy reformation of ITAM's operations following the loss of the organization's reputation as a result of the civil war. Peter began setting about repositioning projects to help mold the broken organization into an independent nation-state in its own right with the interim name of the Federation of Pangea.

He helped to work and guide the formation of a philosophy and doctrine, something that could truly become a tool towards the betterment of humanity all the while continuing to serve it in its best capacity.

He sought something absolute, holistic, and simple. It was all done through trial and error; nothing came easily and there were many hard lessons learned. And all of this he tried to do with as little direct influence as possible. Even now, he was hesitant to assume an official leadership role and instead chose to work on his own, providing guidance and input remotely. Being away from the leaders, the peers, the subordinates, alleviated the sense of his responsibility, hence his grassland hermitage.

His daydreaming was cut short by Millie who materialized in the air above his desk.

"Hey" she playfully shouted at him, "wake up!"

"I'm awake, I'm awake" Peter grumbled.

"Well, try and look it, kiddo, we've got company." She waved a hologram to the center console which showed a sailing vessel skimming across the grassland. Someone was coming to see him in his little hideaway.

One of the two signatures onboard indicated Arthur. The robot had continued to serve as his assistant and official attache and was currently ferrying his guest who had requested this face-to-face meeting. Peter's location was not a real secret, but he appreciated his privacy and the coordinates were not maintained in any official maps of _Pangea_.

His visitor was General Madeline Doyle and from her prior communications, this was an urgent, top-secret meeting of vital importance. He had met the general on a few occasions but her reputation as a serious woman of action had prompted him to accept the audience.

Peter turned away from the screens and walking up a short flight of stairs he came directly to the outside landscape. Having the office space in its own dedicated module gave a nice separation between home and work.

Outside was the grassland - Peter's favorite environment on _Pangea_. While he had explored a variety of other terrains, including the deserts and mounts which he loved for their ruggedness, he ultimately settled on the simplicity that the great plains offered. Peter called them the "grass sea." They were formed from swaths of currently unused portions of _Pangea_'s surface and provided oxygen and healthy soil.

Millie again materialized next to him.

"You can't get away from me that easily."

"I wasn't trying to escape" smiled Peter.

"Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Just getting up and walking away mid-sentence is totally normal."

"Oh, sorry, I totally didn't mean to do that."

Millie ignored his apology and looked at him intently. "This meeting has got you distracted, ruffled."

Peter's mouth set in a line as he shook his head. "No."

Millie sighed with exasperation.

"I _know_ this isn't your favorite thing, but it's necessary. Something is happening, something's coming, and we need to be able to hit the ground running when it does."

The two walked across the small compound. Only short, cylindrical shapes sticking up just higher than the grass indicated the presence of the underground buildings. An office, living quarters, dining area, exercise room. A small docking pool for vehicles. Home.

The pair approached a raised dias equipped with embedded holographic emitters which served as an outdoors office for Peter.

"Well" said Millie, "I've got some other stuff to do, so I'll see you in a bit."

"Meet back up for dinner?"

"Sounds good."

The AI dematerialized and the human walked up the dias. Millie had worked closely with him over the years serving as liaison and helping to train Peter on the technical aspects of his role. Through it all they have formed a strong bond together, forged in the crucible of their initial meeting and subsequent trials. Peter could talk to her about things that he told no one else; interestingly enough, she often did the same. She was a good friend and a trusted confidant.

The rest of the afternoon followed the typical routine of continuing to maintain the Federation's structures, operations, and directives while the little team waited for their guest to arrive. Eventually the sun began to move lower in the sky and Peter returned to the kitchen room. He began to prepare dinner and chatted with Millie while she tossed a holographic ball against the wall.

Outside the evening breeze hissing through the tall grass was interrupted by the whine of an approaching engine. The two stepped out of the doorway and saw the skiff they observed earlier landing in the vehicle pool. Doyle stood by looking on as Arthur jumped down and tethered the vehicle. A boarding ramp extended from the ship and Doyle briskly walked down to meet them.

She wore civilian clothes but her heavy-duty military-grade boots were a telltale signal of her profession.

"Good evening, General Doyle" said Peter as he stepped forward to shake hands.

"Good afternoon, Proctor."

"This is Millie. I believe the two of you have worked before."

"Yes, we have" nodded Doyle to Millie, "on several projects."

"How was your trip?" asked Millie.

"Quick and uneventful, thank you."

"Glad to hear it. Please, come inside. Arthur will finish up dinner and we can eat shortly." Peter led them into the dining room and Arthur disappeared through the connecting door to the kitchen. The three chatted while Arthur completed preparing the meal and served it in short order.

"You want to sit outside?" Peter asked as they wrapped up dinner. "It's quite nice outside in the evening."

"Certainly."

The sun was low in the sky and the afternoon's crisp blue and white sky had turned to purple and orange as they ascended onto the dias. Peter extended a hand and two small benches cascaded into existence as well as a small fire pit between then. Logs appear and ignited, burning rapidly into glowing embers. Orange tongues of fire occasionally licked up from the mouth formed by the wood.

"This is my outdoors work station when the weather is nice."

"It's certainly conducive to expansive thought" noted Doyle looking out across the darkening landscape.

"Freedom to work and learn without interruption. I like focusing singularly on a task, to settle in and zone out while working - it's almost meditative in a way. I guess that would make this my own little Bodhi Tree of sorts. Not that I'm the Buddha. In fact, I'm more the antithesis to that great thinker: where he taught inner perfection, I enforce external rightness. But we both have our Bodhi Trees."

"Well" said Doyle as she leaned back in her chair "your "exile" doesn't seem to have prevented you from keeping yourself well-rounded and knowledgeable."

"I'm always curious."

"A good trait to have. I expect it has also made you aware of the rumblings - the reason for my visit?"

Peter was silent for a moment.

"Not rumblings per se, but there is something stirring in the network and I haven't been able to put my finger on what it is. Something's shifting under the surface, outside of our direction."

Millie, who had been listening to the conversation, chimed in, "I've noticed odd patterns appearing in the data. Increased inbound requests to the network and what looks like some sort of redundant information and resource siloing occurring but it's unclear as to why or who is directing it. The directives appear to be emanating in a distributed manner."

Doyle sat forward, her focus affirming the others' suspicions.

"And there are rumors. More than rumors, steadily growing and of a disturbing nature."

She leaned in even further, heightening the conspiratorial tone.

"There are the beginnings of a coup. Splinter groups within the Federation are planning on wresting control of the organization as a whole through whatever regulatory, legislative, or physical means necessary. The danger of Federation network and resources falling into misguided hands is increasing."

"Should this organization fall away from its intrinsic, core mission, the result would be a calamity the likes of which we have never seen before - but I suppose the two of you know that better than anyone ever could. All of our work, your work, could be undone in the blink of an eye."

Peter and Millie shared a look.

They had worked so hard and for so long, giving their all so that the Federation of Pangea could be a truly great force for the betterment of the world. And the threat that Doyle named could only be true. It was not a surprising label for what the two companions had observed for months without realizing, or wanting to admit, what it could potentially be.

"Are they remnants of the factions involved in the Thirty Minute War?" Thinking back to the primary surviving antagonist of that conflict, Peter could imagine the former CEO and conspirator More in her solitary cell somewhere on Earth. He truly felt sorry for her, such a talent to be locked away forever.

But she was too dangerous to be released and had shown no remorse over her actions. And even if she appeared to be, or honestly was, contrite, she knew too much about the Proctor and there was no telling the damage she could wreak if she were loose.

"We are unsure of the exact source, or the individuals involved, and I've heard too many different versions at this point to provide any meaningful answer." Her voice lowered. "But the most disturbing claim is that Lewis is at the center."

Peter stiffened.

After the ITAM civil war he had worked closely with Lewis who had been vindicated and mostly socially rehabilitated following the war, although many still treated him with some distrust due to his allowing the war to occur at all. Over time, Peter learned to work with him and the pair enjoyed a good working, professional relationship. They met relatively often in person and Lewis was the one exception to Peter's self-impose hermitage away from the rest of humanity.

In return, Lewis brought Peter off world on visits to the various astrological and astronautical projects underway. It was a a master-apprentice relationship of sorts. Not personal friends, but close nonetheless.

Sometime ago, Lewis had become more hands-off in his approach, letting Peter work on his own. However, this now struck the Proctor as an odd coincidence with the beginnings of the first occurrences of the rumblings they were now discussing. His stomach lurched at the prospect of potential treachery from his greatest teacher; he certainly hoped that this were not the case but he knew the extent of Lewis's abilities and the opacity of his nature.

Millie gave him a guarded look, not wanting to share what she knew in front of Doyle.

"Regardless, a serious situation appears to be unfolding and I've brought the results of our intelligence gathering for you to review. This conspiracy appears to go well beyond Federation boundaries, bleeding into other natural entities and countries. Beyond the Federation, greater humanity is at risk of war."

She handed Peter a small datafile which he briefly opened and began absorbing and processing in the background while they talked. Everything fit with what Doyle had just told them. Doyle looked a bit uncomfortable, aware of the awkward request she was making of the Proctor.

"We need you to head off the threat, to address it directly. We need your direct involvement in this situation."

The general was here to convince him to become a proactive solution to this potential problem. Suddenly everything felt just as it had years ago, standing at that conference table at the outbreak of the civil war.

"That-that's not my place. Direct involvement in governance is against my main directives. I provide guidance and project management only."

"Yes, but-"

"And I could continue to fulfill that directive even after the results of this potential coup" interrupted Peter, pressing his point. "Whatever the outcome, whoever ends on top, be it your regime or someone else's, I must continue to do what is good for the Federation of Pangea and humanity. It doesn't matter what name I answer to."

"We've taken this approach for years" added Millie. "Hundreds of tasks and projects have been successfully implemented following our guidance and us following our primary directive."

For a moment, Doyle sat silent formulating her next words.

"What this coup means, what it really means, is that there is someone out there willing to break the rules. Whether or not their end goal is greater than ours, let alone good at all, is besides the point. All I know is that the Federation of Pangea is at this very minute fulfilling a great and noble goal."

"Now there is someone stepping forward, either for good or for evil, to seize power outside of the proper means to do so. In either case, they must be stopped and we'll have lost nothing for having done it."

It was an uncomfortable proposition: the potential for another civil war, perhaps worse, much worse, than the last.

"War is just if it is a necessary defense against evil."

"And who's side of this new civil war will you be on?"

"I've actively sought out alternatives to identify and meet this threat head-on."

"My allegiance lies with the mission of Pangea."

Doyle again looked uncomfortable.

"This brings me to my final point: we need your presence, your physical presence."

"I can work from here, even if I choose to support this anti-coup effort" Peter objected.

The general shook her head.

"No, you must be there in-person. It's necessary for the leadership and the broader community to see your direct involvement. The direct presence of the Proctor will shore up support as well as provide a direct link to the resources under your command. Should it eventually come to it, you'll have to engage in combat either directly or indirectly."

"Honestly, this breaks with the whole intent of my self-imposed exile here on _Pangea_. Avoiding outside interference or control has been my number one priority following the Thirty Minute War. I never want to be manipulated like that again, there's just too much at stake. If I become involved, it'll just increase the tensions and inevitably lead to strife."

"This situation arose regardless of those decisions" said Doyle softly.

A silence fell over the group and they stared into the glowing embers.

"If it truly comes to it" signed Doyle "you will receive orders from the Federation of Pangea board of directors compelling your cooperation with the counter-coup and any necessary defenses. Pangea is unwilling for you to simply choose to remain neutral in the coming conflict."

"Why even ask us, then? Why this sad pretense of freedom?" asked Millie, quietly.

Doyle was silent. Peter looked down at his hands, slowly and gently clenching and unclenching them, watching the patterns of his creases and callouses move.

"I don't have much of a choice, do I?"

"No."

"You must understand, if not now then hopefully eventually you will, that you cannot be allowed to become a pawn in a nefarious plan despite your good intentions. It is far better you become directly involved with the counter-coup unwillingly. Your official orders will be issued in the morning."

Peter nodded, resigning himself to his fate. The fire began burning low and the three again looked on in silence.

Eventually, Doyle excused herself and Arthur appeared to show her to her room. Millie too disappeared for the night, leaving Peter alone on the platform.

Sweeping away the furniture back into energy, he was left on the platform with nothing around him except the black landscape and the expanse of stars above.
