Following Lewis's announcement, the mood of the camp fell.

Regardless, Peter's training began immediately and he was rapidly introduced to a rigorous daily schedule. A variety of martial activities filled his time with a significant portion dedicated to direct combat and tactics.

While a great deal of the equipment was similar to that used in the prior civil war, it had improved greatly in the interim. The armor suits were more comprehensively plated and built for direct combat.

Propulsion systems were integrated into the equipment as well as a new system of mobility. A form of localized molecular dispersal allowing rapid movement across the field instantaneously, nicknamed "rifting", or disintegrating into rushing particles, nicknamed "smoking", to fly across the battlefield. Both forms were limited in range and duration, but necessitated bringing back old fashioned hand-to-hand engagements as combatants could quickly close distances between one another. It was an immense ability but not easily controlled.

He also began learning to control the "Bigs" while acting as a "Small" - balancing his own actions while guiding the actions of the "Big" - a difficult relationship to master. Having Millie by his side was hugely beneficial as he could offload much of the coordination into her hands while focusing on the engagement at hand. While he struggled initially, he overcame the hurdle and began to build a strong capability with her support.

Under the tutelage of Bernard, he also began to master his personal weaponry. Due to the increased defensive capacity afforded by the suits, hand-held blades allowed for more effective damage to be dealt.

These simple, old school weapons, now imbued with high technology, required possibly the most practice to wield them effectively.

And Bernard was a master.

Her moves were fluid yet absolute. There was never a single doubt about hear footwork, bladework, balance, or control. Even in the controlled environment of his training, he observed the full whirlwind of her capabilities many times - even going as far as to take on nearly half a dozen of her own squad single handedly, an engagement she quickly emerged from victorious and completely unscathed.

Her prowess was near-legendary among the ranks and he was fortunate to have her as a teacher.

Working with the company and his team came with its own challenges. After working as a hermit for so long, it was a bit of a culture shock to have to rely on and work so closely with a small, tightly-knit group of people.

They were a highly competitive group and initially regarded Peter with jealousy or disdain even but after working with him, side by side, and even being placed under his command in several training sessions, began to trust his abilities on the field and as a member of their team. And while his position as Proctor was still in effect, he was seen as a sort of "first among equals" in the company under Bernard's leadership.

While he still sought silence and solitude, whenever he could manage it, he had built a respect for his teammates and enjoyed their company. It was pulling him out of his comfort zone and developing him more than he ever expected to.

Arthur had also been separated from him upon his assignment to Bernard's squad. He was still present, assigned to the command center as an attache to Admiral George, but Peter only saw him infrequently and his training hardly allowed him time to miss his former companion.

Despite their predicament, which haunted Peter daily, the immersive nature of the training was immensely enjoyable. But time and time again, the darkness of the situation would reemerge.

Rumblings were steadily growing around Lewis's potential, future moves. Headlines and announcements across the world continued to point towards an inevitable conflict. Disparate factions were rising in several countries, calling for overthrows, often violently, of established governments.

External support for the Federation was rapidly falling away leaving increasingly reduced ability for the nation to defend itself. No war declaration against the Federation was forthcoming, but the increased mobilization of soldiers and weapons indicated it was not far off. A number of small skirmishes had occurred as Lewis's forces probed defensive capabilities and made forays into loyalist territory to seize supplies.

It was highly disconcerting how far the former chairman's reach extended. Often, resources would dry up or simply disappear, just as they were being incorporated into the loyalists plans - it was as if Lewis could see exactly what they were preparing and deprive them of the resources just as they were needed.

He was siphoning away their strength bit by bit. It was clear they were the victim of a mole and Arthur, being the sole individual independent from the military operations, other than Peter who was preoccupied with training, was put in charge of running the traitor or traitors to ground. Full access to resources were granted to the robot in the search for any and all leaks in their network.

Peter was sitting on some crates outside of the docking bay between training sessions looking over the terrain thinking to himself while eating his lunch.

Bernard walked up behind him dressed in fatigues and waved Peter to sit as he attempted to stand to attention. She hopped up onto the crate next to him.

"Captain."

"Lieutenant."

"Preparations seem to be going pretty well."

Bernard nodded.

"Yes, they're certainly moving fast enough."

Peter looked down at his food. Bernard looked over at him.

"What is it?"

He paused a moment and took a deep breath before letting out a long, quiet sigh.

"I'm not sure we'll ever be really prepared for what's coming. We might just manage to get everything together in time but still come up short."

He continued, "Lewis is way more dangerous than you could possibly know. It's clear that he's a master strategist, and even if we ever gain a tactical advantage, he'll still win this war."

Bernard's brow furrowed slightly. It was rare to see actual consternation from her.

"Why do you say that?"

"My history is proof."

He paused again.

"I've never talked about this, and not much was made of it following the civil war. The hearings only briefly touched on it, oddly enough, and it was never publicized in its full context."

"Lewis orchestrated the entirety of the Thirty-Minute War. He did it to both instigate and bring about the downfall of rebellious factions within ITAM and expunge any possible threats to my ascension as Proctor."

"He's the reason I'm here at all. There's nothing to say that he hasn't also planned out every single step of this campaign as well. For all we know, this is just an extension of that civil war - this is just another step in whatever his plan is."

He turned to look the captain in the eye.

"But his most dangerous asset, by far, is his knowledge of me. He knows my history - he was responsible for all of it, he ordered it. He's known every minute of every process; worked with me, molded me, my thinking, my abilities."

"I'm both the king and the pawn in his game and everything that I hope to do he will counter. And he won't just counter it - he'll use it to his advantage."

Bernard silently looked on as Peter spoke. Breaking her gaze, he looked away across the landscape.

"You're really worried about this, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Well, that's combat for you."

"There's always a chance that the enemy is just better, no matter how well or how hard you fight."

"No one's better than you" muttered Peter.

"Not that I've met, no, but that doesn't mean there isn't."

"How will you win when you do encounter that enemy?"

"I don't know. But I'm going to fight."

Peter snorted quietly. Bernard was an impressive individual and despite his misgivings one couldn't help but feel invincible around her. She placed a hand on his shoulder and they smiled at each other.

Millie appeared in the air next to them, "Back to headquarters, now!"

"What is it?"

"You'll see - move!"

The pair sprinted off towards the center of the compound. They dashed into the war room again filled with officers looking solemn.

Another hologram of Lewis stood over the middle of the table. Again, Peter stepped forward and activated it with a wave of his hand and the message began to play.

"As per my previously stated intentions, which are known and open, I am attempting to work in ITAM & Co.'s best interests with all that I do. Today, minority interest of outstanding shares of the state entity Federation Holdings, formerly ITAM & Co., was purchased by my subsidiary, Carthago Capital. This interest, alongside the collective minority stakes held by a private syndicate, has established a controlling stake in the company operations."

A list briefly flashed before them displaying the list of owners.

"We are ordering the immediate dismissal of the board of directors, disarmament of all Federation of Pangea forces, and the arrest of the Proctor. A global announcement to this affect has been made and further announcements will be made at a later time concerning the future of ITAM & Co."

The hologram flicked off.

Peter looked to Doyle.

"We need to stop this" he said.

"Agreed. There have been no communications from the board of directors. It is likely that they were complicit with this move by Lewis."

Bustling resumed around them in the command room as officers began to move to prove the veracity of Lewis's statements.

Doyle ushered Peter over to a separate desk cluster.

"We'll establish a unit to do whatever is necessary to interface with the loyalists within the business units to halt this move if possible."

Peter nodded. Nothing good could come from this grab for power. It was a clear and immediate escalation of their conflict - an alarming situation.

Arthur found his way through the bustle to Peter and Doyle.

"Sir, I believe I've found something important."

"What is it?"

Arthur activated a hologram which showed a large chart with hundreds of elements and connecting lines making it look like something out of a conspiracy theorist's wall.

"With that announcement, and based off of the list that Lewis disclosed, it has confirmed the pattern we have observed in recent months. Approximately 58% of all liquidations, business divestures, external acquisitions, employment decision, and corporate strategy in the prior three months flowed through a resource directly held by Lewis. The remaining 42% of all actions flowed through these resources indirectly held by Lewis."

The queasy feeling returned.

"He's been planning this for a very long time and taken steps to prepare his exact footing before he launched himself down this path. That announcement was just an attempt to bully us into submission and make us look weak publicly."

"He fully expects war. He wants it now."

The bustle around them had increased. A staffer ran over to Doyle.

"Ma'am, there are reports coming in from across our holdings - a large-scale defection is underway."

Another shouted "Ma'am! We're receiving reports of coordinated attacks on our positions!"

A claxon sounded overhead.

"ALL PERSONNEL: BATTLE STATIONS THIS IS NOT A DRILL REPEAT BATTLE STATIONS THIS IS NOT A DRILL"

Doyle and Peter shared a look. The opening moves were over. They were officially in the middle of the game.
